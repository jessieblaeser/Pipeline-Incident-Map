ONCE THE INCIDENT WAS MADE SAFE IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD STOPPED THE RAILROAD FOR MORE THAN THE 20-MINUTE THRESHOLD THE COMPANY HAS IN ITS OPERATIONS PROCEDURE MANUAL (OPM) FOR REPORTING WHERE THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS CONTACTED AT THAT TIME. NOTIFICATION TO THE ONE-CALL CENTER WAS MADE, HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THE LOCATE TICKET HAD EXPIRED AND THE MARKS AT THE JOB SITE WERE FADED. IN ADDITION, THE FADED MARKS APPEARED TO BE MIS-LOCATED BY APPROXIMATELY 6-INCHES WHERE THE EXCAVATOR HAD FAILED TO POTHOLE TO DETERMINE THE PROXIMITY OF THE PIPELINE.     ADDITIONAL NRC REPORT NUMBER 1269835 WAS CREATED FOR THE SAME EVENT AFTER A SUPPLEMENTAL CALL WAS PLACED WITH THE NRC TO UPDATE THE INITIAL TELEPHONIC NOTICE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

THE FIRE CONSISTED OF BURNING WOODEN PALLETS, MATTRESSES AND OTHER TYPES OF FURNITURE AND ITEMS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE ACCUMULATED FROM PERSONS LIVING UNDERNEATH THE BRIDGE. UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HEAT FROM THIS FIRE DAMAGED A 4-INCH PE PLASTIC ONE-WAY FEED MAIN INSERTED INTO A 16-INCH STEEL CASING, CAUSING IT TO FAIL. ONCE THE INCIDENT WAS MADE SAFE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCIDENT WOULD EXCEED THE $122,000 THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING WHERE THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS CONTACTED AT THAT TIME. THE ATLANTA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS DETERMINED THAT THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE BRIDGE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED AND THE BRIDGE WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED.

      "1077    ON 11-15-19 DOMINION WAS NOTIFIED BY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AT 1:01 AM OF A FIRE ON OR NEAR THE OPERATORS PIPELINE. DEO CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRE WAS OCCURRING ON ITS FACILITIES AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45 AM BASED ON COMMUNICATIONS WITH FIELD OPERATIONS AND GAS CONTROL. THE LINE WAS ISOLATED AND FIRE EXTINGUISHED AT 3:30AM. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR STRUCTURE DAMAGES. THE 30 INCH STEEL MAIN HAD BEEN RECENTLY INSTALLED, AND THE LOCATION OF THE RELEASE WAS AT A ROAD CROSSING AUGURED UNDER THE ROAD INSTALLED AT APPROXIMATELY 14.5FT. DEEP ON THE SOUTH END TO APPROXIMATELY 21FT. DEEP ON THE NORTH END. ON 11-24-19 THE FAILED SECTION WAS REMOVED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE RELEASE OF GAS HAD OCCURRED AT A GIRTH WELD FAILURE. IN COOPERATION WITH THE PUCO, THE FAILED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE (ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL SECTIONS IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE SECTION CONTAINING ADDITIONAL WELDS FOR TESTING) WERE EXTRACTED AND RETAINED BY DNV FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE PROTOCOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS WERE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY DEO AND THE PUCO. DNV ISSUED ITS FINAL METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT ON 5-18-20, AND DEO HAS CONCLUDED ITS REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT.  ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT INDICATES THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF AXIAL BENDING STRESSES ON THE PIPE STRING, LIKELY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A CAVERN OR VOID IN THE ROCK FORMATION THROUGH WHICH THE AUGER PASSED, WHICH CAUSED THE AUGER TO VEER OFF COURSE. THE BENDING STRESS CAUSED THE FIELD GIRTH WELD LOCATED AT THE EDGE OF THE CAVERN TO FAIL, PRIMARILY IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO DETERMINED THAT A PRE-EXISTING HYDROGEN CRACK (FORMED PRIOR TO THE FINAL FAILURE) AND WELDING DEFICIENCIES CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED STRESS STATE ON THE GIRTH WELD.\n",

      "680    ON JULY 2, 2016 AT 02:59 DTE GAS WAS NOTIFIED OF A FIRE FROM THE MELVINDALE FIRE DEPARTMENT AT 3900 GREENFIELD IN MELVINDALE, MI.  THE DTE GAS SERVICE TECHNICIAN TEAM ARRIVED ONSITE AT 03:10 AND IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT A VEHICLE HAD HIT ABOVE GROUND PIPING OF A  3\" NIPPLE ON A BLOW-OFF  WHICH LEAD TO A RUPTURE OF A 30-INCH PIPELINE OPERATING AT 540 PSIG AT THE DTE GAS RIVER ROUGE FACILITY. DTE GAS COORDINATED WITH FIRST RESPONDERS TO CONTAIN THE INCIDENT. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE VEHICLE CROSSED THROUGH THE STATION YARD AND STRUCK THE 3\" NIPPLE ON A BLOW-OFF, THE LEAKING GAS DID IGNITE WHICH CAUSE THE 30-INCH PIPELINE RUPTURE. THERE WAS ONE INJURY TO THE DRIVER. THE DRIVER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN INTOXICATED PRIOR TO THE VEHICLE STRIKING THE 3\" NIPPLE ON A BLOW-OFF. DTE GAS CONTROL WAS ABLE TO CLOSE THE REMOTE VALVE AND THE LEAKING GAS WAS STOPPED. AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT, OAKWOOD HOSPITAL, DEARBORN INDUSTRIAL GENERATION AND MARATHON DETROIT REFINERY WERE WITHOUT HIGH PRESSURE GAS. OAKWOOD HOSPITAL WAS RETURN TO SERVICE ON AFTERNOON OF JULY 2, 2016. DEARBORN INDUSTRIAL GENERATION AND MARATHON DETROIT REFINERY WERE RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 12 NOON ON JULY 12, 2016. REMEDIATION OF THE RIVER ROUGE GAS FACILITY WAS COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2016 .\n",

      "734    FINAL UPDATE 11/21/2018 - THE TOTAL DAMAGES IN PART D,2.D. ARE UPDATED TO SHOW BEST KNOWN PUBLIC DAMAGE ESTIMATES.    SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE 06/01/2017 - THE NUMBER OF INJURIES REQUIRING INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION WAS UPDATED, INCLUDING A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC AND AN AMEREN ILLINOIS CONTRACT LOCATOR.  THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF PUBLIC DAMAGES IS STILL THE BEST KNOWN ESTIMATE.     SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE 03/16/2017 - ESTIMATE OF $5MM PUBLIC DAMAGE ADDED. THIS IS UNSUBSTANTIATED ESTIMATE AND WILL BE UPDATED ONCE BETTER INFORMATION IS KNOWN.     A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR WAS DIRECTIONAL BORING TO INSTALL TELECOMMUNICATION UTILITY FACILITIES AND HIT AN AMEREN ILLINOIS (AIC) GAS FACILITY. AIC RESPONDED TO THE HIT FACILITY AND HAD FOUR EMPLOYEES WORKING AT THE SCENE WHEN THE BUILDING AT 50 N 1ST AVENUE EXPLODED. ONE AIC EMPLOYEE WAS KILLED AND THREE WERE INJURED, TWO OF WHICH REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.    ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE INCIDENT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BUREAU (NTSB).     CLARIFICATION ON RESPONSES AS FOLLOWS:  A.12 - THERE WERE NEWS REPORTS OF 12 INJURIES INCLUDING AIC EMPLOYEES. AT THIS TIME WE ARE ONLY AWARE OF THE INJURIES TO AIC EMPLOYEES REQUIRING INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION, AND ARE NOTE AWARE IF OTHER INJURIES REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.  A.16 - THE EAST SIDE OF THE SQUARE WAS EVACUATED BY EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS EVACUATED IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME. THE RESPONSE OF 50 IS AN UNSUBSTANTIATED ESTIMATE OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN AND AROUND THE SQUARE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVACUATED.  D.2.A. - THE EXTENT OF PUBLIC DAMAGES TO PROPERTY WILL MOST LIKELY BE IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AT THIS TIME, AIC DOES NOT HAVE A VALID ESTIMATION OF THIS AMOUNT.  G.13.A. - THIS DURATION REPRESENTS THE TIME THAT THE FIRST SYSTEM VALVES WERE CLOSED TO ISOLATE GAS MAINS TO THE TIME THE LAST GAS MAIN SEGMENT WAS REPRESSURIZED AND PUT BACK INTO SERVICE.\n",

      "450    DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:    ON MARCH 12, 2014 AT APPROXIMATELY 09:31 TWO MULTI-USE, FIVE-STORY BUILDINGS AT 1644 AND 1646 PARK AVENUE (WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E. 116TH AND E. 117TH STREETS), NEW YORK, NY, WERE DESTROYED BY AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE.  EIGHT FATALITIES AND APPROXIMATELY 48 REPORTED INJURIES RESULTED FROM THE EXPLOSION AND COLLAPSE.    CON EDISON'S RESPONSE AND ACTION:    AT 09:13 ON MARCH 12, 2014, CON EDISON'S GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER (GERC) RECEIVED A TELEPHONE REPORT FROM CON EDISON'S CALL CENTER OF AN INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GAS ODOR AT 1652 PARK AVENUE.  AT 09:15, GERC DISPATCHED A GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) MECHANIC TO INVESTIGATE THE ODOR REPORT.  AT 09:34, GERC CONFIRMED WITH NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT (FDNY) A SCANNER REPORT OF AN EXPLOSION AND BUILDING COLLAPSE AT E. 114TH ST. AND PARK AVENUE (THE E. 114TH ST. LOCATION WAS INCORRECT).  AT 09:38, THE GDS MECHANIC ENROUTE TO 1652 PARK AVENUE REPORTED OBSERVING SMOKE, FLAMES, AND HEAVY ACTIVITY ON PARK AVENUE SOUTH OF E. 119TH STREET.  GERC DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL CON EDISON PERSONNEL TO THE LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 09:38.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL FIRST ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION AT 09:40 AND CONFIRMED THE EXPLOSION AND COLLAPSE OF TWO BUILDINGS ON PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E. 116TH ST. AND E. 117TH ST.    NUMEROUS CON EDISON PERSONNEL, INCLUDING GDS MECHANICS, CONSTRUCTION CREWS, SUPERVISORS, PLANNERS, AND MANAGERS RESPONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSE.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION FOR GAS MIGRATION THAT INCLUDED ADJACENT BUILDINGS AND ACCESSIBLE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES IN THE AREA.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THREE (3) FIRE BANK LOCATIONS FOR EXCAVATION TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E 116TH ST AND E 117TH ST.  AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, A STREET COLLAPSE AND AN APPARENT WATER MAIN BREAK WERE OBSERVED IN THE ROADWAY IN FRONT OF 1644 AND 1646 PARK AVENUE.  AT THE TIME OF THE STREET COLLAPSE, THERE WAS A STRONG ODOR OF GAS IN THE AREA.    FIRE BANK EXCAVATIONS WERE COMPLETED AND STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED TO ISOLATE THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, AND THE ODOR OF GAS DISSIPATED.  THE 8\" LOW PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE / 8\" LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN SUPPLYING (7) SERVICES ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE AND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF E. 116TH ST., BETWEEN PARK AVENUE AND MADISON AVENUE, WERE ISOLATED.    INVESTIGATION:    FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) TOOK CONTROL OF THE INCIDENT SITE AND BEGAN ITS INVESTIGATION. THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, AND GEORG FISCHER CENTRAL PLASTIC WERE PARTIES TO THE INVESTIGATION. DURING THE COURSE OF THE NTSB INVESTIGATION, CON EDISON PROVIDED A PARTY SUBMISSION DESCRIBING THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AS A BREACH IN THE SEWER SYSTEM WHICH CAUSED SOIL EROSION AFFECTING SUBSURFACE UTILITIES, INCLUDING A CAST IRON WATER MAIN AND HDPE GAS FACILITIES, AND LIKELY RESULTED IN AN IMPACT BY FALLING ROADWAY PAVEMENT WHICH CRACKED THE SERVICE TEE TO 1642 PARK AVENUE. IN ITS ACCIDENT REPORT ADOPTED ON JUNE 9, 2015, THE NTSB DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS (1) THE FAILURE OF THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT AT THE SERVICE TEE, INSTALLED BY CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, INC., IN 2011, THAT ALLOWED NATURAL GAS TO LEAK FROM THE GAS MAIN AND MIGRATE INTO THE BUILDING WHERE IT IGNITED AND (2) A BREACH IN THE SEWER LINE THAT WENT UNREPAIRED BY THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SINCE AT LEAST 2006 THAT ALLOWED GROUNDWATER AND SOIL TO FLOW INTO THE SEWER, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF SUPPORT FOR THE GAS MAIN, WHICH CAUSED THE LINE TO SAG AND OVERSTRESSED THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT.                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "947    ON NOVEMBER 25, 2018, AT 16:44, CON EDISON'S GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER (GERC) RECEIVED A REPORT FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK (FDNY) OF AN ELECTRICAL FIRE AT 2465 BROADWAY IN MANHATTAN. THE FDNY REPORTED THAT THE FIRE WAS PRODUCING ELEVATED LEVELS OF CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) AND THAT ONSITE FDNY PERSONNEL HAD DETECTED CO IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, WHICH CONTAINS A LARGE EQUINOX GYM. AT 16:45, CON EDISON'S GERC DISPATCHED A MECHANIC TO THE LOCATION FROM ITS GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) DEPARTMENT. PRIOR TO THE GDS MECHANIC'S ARRIVAL, THE FDNY EVACUATED AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS FROM BUILDINGS ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF BROADWAY BETWEEN WEST 91ST AND WEST 92ND STREETS DUE TO THE CO CONDITION. THE CON EDISON GDS MECHANIC ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 17:17 AND BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE. AT 17:34, THE GDS MECHANIC REPORTED A 50% NATURAL GAS READING FIVE FEET FROM THE FOUNDATION WALL OF THE BUILDING AT 2465 BROADWAY. THERE WAS NO ACCESS INTO THE BUILDING AT THAT TIME DUE TO THE CO CONDITION. A MULTIPLE RESOURCE RESPONSE EVENT (CODE MURRE) WAS THEN INITIATED BY CON EDISON DUE TO THE COMBINED INVOLVEMENT OF BOTH ELECTRIC AND GAS. ADDITIONAL CON EDISON GAS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE THEN DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION. AT 18:17, THE GDS MECHANIC REPORTED THAT AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED INSIDE THE EQUINOX GYM, SHATTERING THE BUILDING'S WINDOWS. THE GERC THEN DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL CON EDISON GAS PERSONNEL TO THE LOCATION TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. AT 18:34, ONSITE GDS PERSONNEL REPORTED HAVING NO ACCESS TO THE CURB VALVE ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE SUPPLYING 2465 BROADWAY DUE TO UNSAFE CONDITIONS IN THE SIDEWALK AREA RELATED TO AN APPARENT UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC CABLE BURNOUT. BY 20:39, CON EDISON PERSONNEL CLOSED THREE LOW-PRESSURE MAIN VALVES TO ISOLATE THE AREA, WHICH INTERRUPTED GAS SERVICE TO NINE BUILDINGS AND 538 CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, CON EDISON ELECTRIC OPERATIONS PERSONNEL DE-ENERGIZED THE ELECTRIC SUPPLY ON THE WEST SIDE OF BROADWAY BETWEEN WEST 91ST AND WEST 92ND STREETS, AND CONFIRMED THAT AN UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC CABLE BURNOUT HAD OCCURRED IN THE AREA IN FRONT OF 2465 BROADWAY.AT 21:47, CON EDISON PERSONNEL REPORTED, PER THE ONSITE FDNY BATTALION CHIEF,THAT A SUSPECTED NATURAL GAS IGNITION HAD OCCURRED INSIDE OF THE EQUINOX GYM. THE FDNY ALSO REPORTED DETECTING 3.5 PERCENT NATURAL GAS-IN-AIR (70 PERCENT OF THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT) INSIDE THE BUILDING'S BASEMENT STAIRCASE PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.CON EDISON GDS PERSONNEL THEN GAINED ACCESS TO THE BUILDING AND DETECTED 0.2 PERCENT NATURAL GAS-IN-AIR AT THE FOUNDATION WALL IN THE BASEMENT IN THE VICINITY OF THE GAS METER, WHICH QUICKLY VENTED TO 0 PERCENT.THE GAS PIPING INSIDE THE BASEMENT AT THE GAS METER WAS FOUND INTACT.  BY 22:45, THE FDNY TERMINATED ALL EVACUATIONS EXCEPT FOR THE AFFECTED BUILDING AT 2465 BROADWAY. THE AREA IS SUPPLIED BY AN 8-INCH AND 6-INCH LOW-PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE (LPPE) GAS MAIN, WITH A 4-INCH LPPE GAS SERVICE SUPPLYING THE BUILDING AT 2465 BROADWAY.CON EDISON CHECKED ODORANT LEVELS AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PRESSURE SUPPLYING THE AREA AFTER THE INCIDENT AND FOUND BOTH TO BE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE RANGES. ON NOVEMBER 26, 2018, AT 10:56, A BASEBALL-SIZED HOLE WAS FOUND IN THE 6-INCH LPPE GAS MAIN IN FRONT OF 2465 BROADWAY. THE HOLE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE ELECTRIC CABLE BURNOUT THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THAT AREA. THE AFFECTED SECTION OF 6-INCH LPPE GAS MAIN WAS CUT OUT AND CAPPED, AND THE THREE CLOSED MAIN VALVES WERE RE-OPENED, RESTORING GAS SUPPLY IN THE AFFECTED AREA.SUBSEQUENT LEAK SURVEYS CONDUCTED IN THE AREA IDENTIFIED TWO GAS LEAK (A TYPE 1 LEAK IN FRONT OF 256 WEST 92ND STREET AND A TYPE 3 LEAK IN FRONT OF 251 WEST 92ND STREET).CON EDISON PINPOINTED AND REPAIRED BOTH LEAKS. AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION, ONE CON EDISON EMPLOYEE WAS TAKEN TO MT. SINAI MEDICAL CENTER, WHERE HE WAS EVALUATED AND RELEASED. NO OTHER INJURIES WERE REPORTED.MULTIPLE MEDIA OUTLETS AND AGENCIES WERE ON LOCATION.NYSPSC, NYCDEP,AND USDOT WERE NOTIFIED.\n",
