Pipeline Safety: Requirement of Valve Installation and Minimum Rupture Detection Standards,Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"PHMSA is revising the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations applicable to most newly constructed and entirely replaced onshore gas transmission, Type A gas gathering, and hazardous liquid pipelines with diameters of 6 inches or greater. In the revised regulations, PHMSA requires operators of these lines to install rupture-mitigation valves (i.e., remote-control or automatic shut-off valves) or alternative equivalent technologies, and establishes minimum performance standards for those valves' operation to prevent or mitigate the public safety and environmental consequences of pipeline ruptures. This final rule establishes requirements for rupture-mitigation valve spacing, maintenance and inspection, and risk analysis. The final rule also requires operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipelines to contact 9- 1-1 emergency call centers immediately upon notification of a potential rupture and conduct post-rupture investigations and reviews. Operators must also incorporate lessons learned from such investigations and reviews into operators' personnel training and qualifications programs, and in design, construction, testing, maintenance, operations, and emergency procedure manuals and specifications. PHMSA is promulgating these regulations in response to congressional directives following major pipeline incidents where there were significant environmental consequences or losses of human life. The revisions are intended to achieve better rupture identification, response, and mitigation of safety, greenhouse gas, and environmental justice impacts.",87 FR 20940, 2022-07133,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/04/08/2022-07133/pipeline-safety-requirement-of-valve-installation-and-minimum-rupture-detection-standards,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-04-08/pdf/2022-07133.pdf,04/08/2022

Hazardous Materials: The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Requirements on Gasoline Transport Vehicles,Notice,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"This proceeding was initiated in February 1998, when the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC) applied to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration \1\ (PHMSA) for a determination that the HMTA preempted certain marking and record keeping requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). PHMSA found that the HMTA preempted the NYSDEC requirements because the requirements were not substantively the same as requirements in the HMR on the marking, maintaining, repairing, or testing of a package or container that is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for transporting hazardous material. NYSDEC's petition for reconsideration of that decision is dismissed on the grounds of mootness. NYSDEC has made significant revisions to its regulations, and the revised rules do not appear to impose the same requirements on regulated entities as the previous version of the rules that were challenged in this proceeding. It therefore does not appear that reconsidering PHMSA's preemption determination regarding the now- superseded NYSDEC rules would have any practical effect. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------",86 FR 30371, 2021-11494,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/07/2021-11494/hazardous-materials-the-new-york-state-department-of-environmental-conservation-requirements-on,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-06-07/pdf/2021-11494.pdf,06/07/2021

Pipeline Safety: Class Location Change Requirements,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"In response to public input received as part of the rulemaking process, PHMSA is proposing to revise the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to amend the requirements for gas transmission pipeline segments that experience a change in class location. Under the existing regulations, pipeline segments located in areas where the population density has significantly increased must perform one of the following actions: Reduce the pressure of the pipeline segment, pressure test the pipeline segment to higher standards, or replace the pipeline segment. This proposed rule would add an alternative set of requirements operators could use, based on implementing integrity management principles and pipe eligibility criteria, to manage certain pipeline segments where the class location has changed from a Class 1 location to a Class 3 location. Through required periodic assessments, repair criteria, and other extra preventive and mitigative measures, PHMSA expects this alternative approach would provide long-term safety benefits consistent with the current natural gas pipeline safety rules while also providing cost savings for pipeline operators.",85 FR 65142, 2020-19872,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/14/2020-19872/pipeline-safety-class-location-change-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-10-14/pdf/2020-19872.pdf,10/14/2020

Hazardous Materials: Vapor Pressure of Unrefined Petroleum Products and Class 3 Materials,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"PHMSA is withdrawing the January 18, 2017, ANPRM concerning vapor pressure for crude oil transported by rail. PHMSA's decision is based on comments received to the ANPRM, as well as an extensive study conducted by the Sandia National Laboratories which found that the vapor pressure of crude oil is not a significant factor in the severity of pool fire or fireball scenarios, and concluded that results of the study do not support creating a regulatory distinction for crude oils based on vapor pressure. In withdrawing the ANPRM, PHMSA is providing notice of its determination that the establishment of vapor pressure limits would not improve the safety of rail transportation of crude oil. Therefore, PHMSA is no longer considering vapor pressure limits for the transportation of crude oil by rail or any other mode. Furthermore, PHMSA is also providing notice that, after considering comments received to the ANPRM, it is no longer considering imposing vapor pressure standards for other unrefined petroleum-based products and Class 3 flammable liquid hazardous materials by any mode.",85 FR 30673, 2020-10377,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/20/2020-10377/hazardous-materials-vapor-pressure-of-unrefined-petroleum-products-and-class-3-materials,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-05-20/pdf/2020-10377.pdf,05/20/2020

Hazardous Materials: New York City Permit Requirements for Transportation of Certain Hazardous Materials,Notice,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"On July 6, 2017, PHMSA published in the Federal Register an administrative determination that Federal hazardous material transportation law preempts, in part, FDNY's permit, inspection, and fee requirements. FDNY has petitioned for reconsideration of that determination. FDNY's petition for reconsideration is granted in part, and denied in part, as follows: 1. Permit and Inspection Requirement--PHMSA affirms its determination that the HMTA preempts FDNY's permit and inspection requirements, FC 2707.4 and 105.6, with respect to vehicles based outside the inspecting jurisdiction, and its determination that the HMTA does not preempt these requirements with respect to vehicles that are based within the inspecting jurisdiction. PHMSA's determination is based on its conclusion that FDNY's permit and inspection requirements create an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out the HMR's prohibition against unnecessary delays in the transportation of hazardous material on vehicles based outside the inspecting jurisdiction. 2. Permit Fee--Based on new information supplied by FDNY, PHMSA reverses its determination that FDNY is not using the revenue it collects from its permit fee for authorized purposes. However, PHMSA affirms its determination that the permit fee is not ``fair,'' as required by 49 U.S.C. 5125(f)(1), and therefore affirms its determination that the permit fee is preempted.",85 FR 29505, 2020-10489,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/15/2020-10489/hazardous-materials-new-york-city-permit-requirements-for-transportation-of-certain-hazardous,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-05-15/pdf/2020-10489.pdf,05/15/2020
Hazardous Materials: The State of Washington Crude Oil by Rail Volatility Requirements,Notice,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"PHMSA finds that the HMTA preempts Washington State's vapor pressure limit for crude oil loaded or unloaded from rail tank cars, for three reasons. First, the vapor pressure requirement constitutes a scheme for classifying a hazardous material that is not substantively the same as the HMR. Second, the vapor pressure requirement imposes requirements on the handling of a hazardous material that are not substantively the same as the requirements of the HMR. Third, PHMSA has determined that the vapor pressure requirement is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out the HMTA. In addition, PHMSA finds that the administrative record regarding Washington State's Advance Notice of Transfer (ANT) requirement is insufficient to make a determination whether the requirement is preempted under the HMTA.",85 FR 29511, 2020-10381,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/15/2020-10381/hazardous-materials-the-state-of-washington-crude-oil-by-rail-volatility-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-05-15/pdf/2020-10381.pdf,05/15/2020

Hazardous Materials: California Meal and Rest Break Requirements,Notice,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"On September 21, 2018, in response to a petition from the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC), PHMSA published a determination that California's meal and rest break rules (MRB Rules) are preempted, under 49 U.S.C. 5125, as applied to drivers of motor vehicles transporting hazardous materials. The California Labor Commissioner's petition for reconsideration of that decision is denied on the grounds of mootness. After PHMSA issued its preemption determination, and after the request for reconsideration was filed, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) determined that the MRB Rules are preempted, under 49 U.S.C. 31141, as applied to property- carrying commercial motor vehicles drivers covered by FMCSA's hours of service regulations. FMCSA's decision covers a broader group of drivers than PHMSA's decision, including NTTC's members. Accordingly, granting the California Labor Commissioner's petition for reconsideration will not change the fact that the MRB Rules cannot be enforced against NTTC's members.",85 FR 10216, 2020-03449,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/02/21/2020-03449/hazardous-materials-california-meal-and-rest-break-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-02-21/pdf/2020-03449.pdf,02/21/2020
Pipeline Safety: Safety of Underground Natural Gas Storage Facilities,Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is publishing this final rule to amend its minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities (UNGSFs). On December 19, 2016, PHMSA issued an interim final rule (IFR) establishing regulations in response to the 2015 Aliso Canyon incident and the subsequent mandate in section 12 of the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016. The IFR incorporated by reference two American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practices (RPs): API RP 1170, ``Design and Operation of Solution-mined Salt Caverns Used for Natural Gas Storage'' (First Edition, July 2015); and API RP 1171, ``Functional Integrity of Natural Gas Storage in Depleted Hydrocarbon Reservoirs and Aquifer Reservoirs'' (First Edition, September 2015). The IFR required each provision in the API RPs to apply as mandatory (i.e., each ``should'' statement would apply as a ``shall'') unless an operator provides written justification for not implementing the practice, including an explanation for why it is impracticable and not necessary for safety. Based on the comments received to the IFR and a petition for reconsideration, PHMSA has determined that the RPs, as originally published, will provide PHMSA with a stronger basis upon which to base enforcement than the IFR. This final rule also addresses recommendations from commenters and a petition for reconsideration of the IFR by modifying compliance timelines, revising the definition of a UNGSF, clarifying the states' regulatory role, reducing recordkeeping and reporting requirements, formalizing integrity management practices, and adding risk management requirements for solution-mined salt caverns.",85 FR 8104, 2020-00565,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/02/12/2020-00565/pipeline-safety-safety-of-underground-natural-gas-storage-facilities,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-02-12/pdf/2020-00565.pdf,02/12/2020

The meeting will take place on June 17, 2019, in Washington, DC. PHMSA developed the United States version of the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) for use by emergency services personnel to provide guidance for initial response to hazardous materials transportation incidents. Since 1980, it has been PHMSA's goal that all public emergency response personnel (e.g., fire-fighting, police, and rescue squads) have free and immediate access to the ERG. To date, PHMSA has distributed more than 14.5 million copies of the ERG to emergency service agencies and developed free online resources and downloadable mobile applications to make the ERG more accessible. Since 1996, PHMSA, Transport Canada, and the Secretariat of Communication and Transport of Mexico have collaborated in development of the ERG, with interested parties from government and industry providing additional assistance, including Argentina's Chemical Information Center for Emergencies (CIQUIME). ERG2020 will be published in English, French, and Spanish and will increase public safety by providing consistent emergency response procedures for hazardous materials transportation incidents throughout North America. During the meeting, PHMSA will respond to stakeholder requests for a public discussion of the methodology used to determine the appropriate response protective distances for poisonous vapors resulting from spills involving dangerous goods considered toxic by inhalation in the ERG2016 ``Green Pages.'' To pursue our objective of continually improving the ERG, PHMSA will solicit comments related to new methodologies and considerations for future editions of the ERG. Additionally, the meeting will include discussions on the outcomes of field experiments, ongoing research efforts to better understand environmental effects on airborne toxic gas concentrations, and updates to be published in the ERG2020. Time and Location: The meeting will be held at the U.S. Department of Transportation Conference Center at 1200 New Jersey Ave. SE, Washington, DC 20590 on June 17, 2019, from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Finally, the California meal and rest break requirements are preempted as to motor carriers who are required to file a security plan under 49 CFR 172.800, and who have filed security plans requiring constant attendance of hazardous materials, because the California requirements are an obstacle to carrying out the requirements of 49 CFR 172.800 with respect to such motor carriers.",83 FR 47961, 2018-20542,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/21/2018-20542/hazardous-materials-california-meal-and-rest-break-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-09-21/pdf/2018-20542.pdf,09/21/2018

Hazardous Materials: Oil Spill Response Plans and Information Sharing for High-Hazard Flammable Trains,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"PHMSA, in consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration, is issuing this NPRM to propose revisions to regulations that would expand the applicability of comprehensive oil spill response plans (OSRPs) based on thresholds of liquid petroleum oil that apply to an entire train consist. Specifically, we are proposing to expand the applicability for comprehensive OSRPs so that any railroad that transports a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train consist must also have a current comprehensive written OSRP. We are further proposing to revise the format and clarify the requirements of a comprehensive OSRP (e.g., requiring that covered railroads develop response zones describing resources available to arrive onsite to a worst-case discharge, or the substantial threat of one, which are located within 12 hours of each point along the route used by trains subject to the comprehensive OSRP). We also solicit comment on defining high volume areas and staging resources using alternative response times, including shorter response times for spills that could affect such high volume areas. Further, in accordance with the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act of 2015, this action proposes to require railroads to share information about high-hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions to improve community preparedness and seeks comments on these proposals. Lastly, PHMSA is proposing to incorporate by reference an initial boiling point test for flammable liquids from the ASTM D7900 method referenced in the American National Standards Institute/American Petroleum Institute Recommend Practices 3000, ``Classifying and Loading of Crude Oil into Rail Tank Cars,'' First Edition, September 2014 as an acceptable testing alternative to the boiling point tests currently specified in the HMR. PHMSA believes providing this additional boiling test option provides regulatory flexibility and promotes enhanced safety in transport through accurate packing group assignment.",81 FR 50067, 2016-16938,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/29/2016-16938/hazardous-materials-oil-spill-response-plans-and-information-sharing-for-high-hazard-flammable,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-07-29/pdf/2016-16938.pdf,07/29/2016

Hazardous Materials: Requirements for the Safe Transportation of Bulk Explosives (RRR),Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations by establishing standards for the safe transportation of explosives on cargo tank motor vehicles and multipurpose bulk trucks transporting materials for blasting operations. This rulemaking is responsive to two petitions for rulemaking submitted by industry representatives: P-1557, concerning the continued use of renewal applications, and P-1583, concerning the incorporation of an industry standard publication. Further, developing these requirements provides wider access to the regulatory flexibility currently only offered by special permits and competent authorities. The requirements of this final rule mirror the majority of provisions contained in nine widely-used longstanding special permits that have established safety records. These requirements eliminate the need for future renewal requests, thus reducing paperwork burdens and facilitating commerce while maintaining a commensurate level of safety. This final rule authorizes the transportation of certain explosives, ammonium nitrates, ammonium nitrate emulsions, and other specific hazardous materials in both non-bulk and bulk packagings, which are not otherwise authorized under current regulations. These hazardous materials are used in blasting operations on cargo tank motor vehicles and specialized vehicles, known as multipurpose bulk trucks, which are used as mobile work platforms to create blends of explosives that are unique to each blast site.

Hazardous Materials: Carriage of Battery-Powered Electronic Smoking Devices in Passenger Baggage,Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"PHMSA is issuing an interim final rule to prohibit passengers and crewmembers from carrying battery-powered portable electronic smoking devices (e.g., e-cigarettes, e-cigs, e-cigars, e-pipes, e- hookahs, personal vaporizers, electronic nicotine delivery systems) in checked baggage and prohibit passengers and crewmembers from charging the devices and/or batteries on board the aircraft. These devices may continue to be carried in carry-on baggage. This action is consistent with a similar action taken by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) that incorporated this restriction into the 2015- 2016 Edition of the ICAO Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air by way of an addendum and is necessary to address an immediate safety risk. This interim final rule does not impact the existing rules on the transport of lithium batteries or other portable electronic devices that are transported for personal use in a passenger's checked or carry-on baggage. Because the actions taken in this interim final rule address a public safety risk, PHMSA finds that good cause exists to amend the regulations without advance notice and opportunity for public comment. For the reasons described below, public notice is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. PHMSA encourages persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting comments containing relevant information, data, or views. We will consider all comments received on or before the closing date for comments. We will consider late filed comments to the extent practicable.

Pipeline Safety: Safety of Hazardous Liquid Pipelines,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"In recent years, there have been significant hazardous liquid pipeline accidents, most notably the 2010 crude oil spill near Marshall, Michigan, during which almost one million gallons of crude oil were spilled into the Kalamazoo River. In response to accident investigation findings, incident report data and trends, and stakeholder input, PHMSA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register on October 18, 2010. The ANPRM solicited stakeholder and public input and comments on several aspects of hazardous liquid pipeline regulations being considered for revision or updating in order to address the lessons learned from the Marshall, Michigan accident and other pipeline safety issues. Subsequently, Congress enacted the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act that included several provisions that are relevant to the regulation of hazardous liquid pipelines. Shortly after the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act was passed, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued its accident investigation report on the Marshall, Michigan accident. In it, NTSB made additional recommendations regarding the need to revise and update hazardous liquid pipeline regulations. In response to these mandates, recommendations, lessons learned, and public input, PHMSA is proposing to make changes to the hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations. PHMSA is proposing these changes to improve protection of the public, property, and the environment by closing regulatory gaps where appropriate, and ensuring that operators are increasing the detection and remediation of unsafe conditions, and mitigating the adverse effects of pipeline failures.",80 FR 61609, 2015-25359,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/10/13/2015-25359/pipeline-safety-safety-of-hazardous-liquid-pipelines,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-10-13/pdf/2015-25359.pdf,10/13/2015

Hazardous Materials: Enhanced Enforcement Procedures-Resumption of Transportation,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"PHMSA is proposing to address certain matters identified in the Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety Act of 2012 related to the Department's enhanced inspection, investigation, and enforcement authority. Specifically, we are proposing to amend the opening of packages provision to include requirements for perishable hazardous material; add a new notification section; and add a new equipment section to the Department's procedural regulations. For the mandates to address certain matters related to the Department's enhanced inspection, investigation, and enforcement authority, we are proposing no additional regulatory changes. We believe that the Department's current rules that were previously established through notice and comment rulemaking and existing policies and operating procedures thoroughly address the hazmat transportation matters identified by Congress. These inspection and enforcement procedures will not change the current inspection procedures for DOT, but will augment DOT's existing enforcement procedures and allow the Department to respond immediately and effectively to conditions or practices that pose serious threats to life, property, or the environment. As this rule affects only agency enforcement procedures, it therefore results in no additional burden of compliance costs to industry.",78 FR 30258, 2013-12123,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/22/2013-12123/hazardous-materials-enhanced-enforcement-procedures-resumption-of-transportation,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-05-22/pdf/2013-12123.pdf,05/22/2013

Hazardous Materials; Temporary Reduction of Registration Fees,Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"The Federal hazardous materials transportation law requires DOT to adjust the amount of the annual registration fee to account for any unexpended balance in the Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness (HMEP) Fund. Due to an unexpended balance that has accumulated in the Fund, PHMSA is lowering the registration fees for registration year 2013-2014 for all persons, as defined in PHMSA regulations, that transport or offer for transportation in commerce certain categories and quantities of hazardous materials. Specifically, for registration year 2013-2014 the fee for a small business or not- for-profit organization is revised to be $125 (plus a $25 processing fee), and for all other businesses the fee is $1300 (plus a $25 processing fee). After the 2013-2014 registration year, the registration fees will return to 2012-2013 registration year levels. Additionally, PHMSA is making an editorial change to its regulations to clarify the appropriate fee amounts; there are no substantive changes other than the addition of the fees for 2013-2014 and for 2014-2015 and later. In order to make the change effective for the 2013-2014 registration year and thus draw down the unexpended balance as soon as possible, PHMSA is issuing this final rule without a prior notice of proposed rulemaking in accordance with good cause exemption specified in the Administrative Procedures Act. Additionally, for good cause this final rule is effective immediately.",78 FR 23503, 2013-09213,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/04/19/2013-09213/hazardous-materials-temporary-reduction-of-registration-fees,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-04-19/pdf/2013-09213.pdf,04/19/2013
