NITROGEN MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE TANK, PRIOR TO THE INITIAL START-UP, BY FLOWING NATURAL GAS INTO THE TANK IN ORDER TO DISPLACE THE NITROGEN.    THE FACILITY AND ITS PRIMARY CONTRACTOR DEVELOPED A PROCEDURE FOR CARRYING OUT THE NITROGEN DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT INITIALLY INCLUDED DIRECTING THE VENT STREAM TO THE LP FLARE. LATER, THE PROCEDURE WAS AMENDED TO PROVIDE FOR VENTING OF THE NITROGEN VIA A ROOF VENT ON THE LNG TANK.  THE FACILITY COMPLETED A MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (""MOC"") EVALUATION FOR THE AMENDED PROCEDURE, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY OPERATIONS, COMMISSIONING, AND ENGINEERING.  ACCORDING TO THE AMENDED PROCEDURE, THE VENTING WOULD BE MONITORED TO DETERMINE WHEN THE NITROGEN DISPLACEMENT WOULD BE COMPLETE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE TANK CONTENTS WOULD BE SWITCHED TO THE LP FLARE.     VENTING OF NITROGEN FROM THE TANK BEGAN ON JANUARY 15, 2022 AT APPROXIMATELY 0300 AND ENDED ON JANUARY 17, 2022 AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS WHEN FACILITY ENVIRONMENTAL PERSONNEL BECAME AWARE OF THE VENTING AND POTENTIAL FOR NATURAL GAS TO BE PRESENT IN THE VENT STREAM.  OPERATIONS WERE PROTECTIVELY CEASED PRIOR TO CONFIRMATION OF THE PRESENCE AND/OR QUANTITY OF ANY NATURAL GAS IN THE VENT.  LATER, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NATURAL GAS MIXED WITH NITROGEN WAS IN FACT EMITTED.     THE PRIMARY ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE EXCLUSION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST/ AIR PERMITTING SPECIALIST IN THE SIGN-OFF APPROVAL OF THE MOC. IF THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS INCLUDED IN THE MOC PROCESS, THE MOC WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN EXECUTED SINCE THE LNG TANK IS NOT AN APPROVED EMISSION SOURCE.     TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE, ANY NITROGEN DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITY USING NATURAL GAS WILL EITHER DIRECT ANY VENT STREAM PURGED FROM THE LNG STORAGE TANKS TO A FLARE OR SUCH ACTIVITY WILL BE PERMITTED PURSUANT TO THE REGULATORY PERMIT IN LAC 33:III.309 OR OTHER APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION FROM THE LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. IN ADDITION, THE FACILITY WILL ENSURE THAT ANY VENTING PROCEDURE AND ANY CHANGES THERETO ARE THOROUGHLY REVIEWED DURING THE MOC PROCESS AND ARE APPROVED BY APPROPRIATE AND RELEVANT STAFF, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL STAFF, IN ADDITION TO OPERATIONS AND ENGINEERING STAFF. FINALLY, ANY PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN NITROGEN PURGING OPERATIONS FOR THE LNG STORAGE TANKS WILL RECEIVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING ON THE PROCEDURES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO ANY FUTURE NITROGEN DISPLACEMENT OPERATIONS."

THE HIGHEST RECORDED PRESSURE DOWNSTREAM OF THE DISTRIBUTION REGULATORS AT SS3 WAS 62PSIG.  AT APPROXIMATELY 4:10PM ON 11/21/2021, A TEMPERATURE SWITCH ON THE OUTLET OF THE VAPORIZER MALFUNCTIONED AND CLOSED A VALVE TO STOP THE FLOW OF LNG THROUGH THE VAPORIZER.  WITH NO LNG TO VAPORIZE, THE GLYCOL HEATER TURNED OFF DUE TO LOW DEMAND.  AT ABOUT 4:55PM, AN OPERATOR NOTICED THAT THE FLOW OF LNG HAD STOPPED, AND THE DISTRIBUTION PRESSURE WAS DROPPING.  THE OPERATOR OPENED THE CLOSED VAPORIZER VALVE VIA REMOTE CONTROL.  THE OPERATOR DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE BOILER WAS NOT FIRING AND DID NOT MONITOR THE SITE LONG ENOUGH TO VERIFY THE SYSTEM WAS STABLE AND PROPER TEMPERATURES WHERE BEING MAINTAINED.  DUE TO THE MALFUNCTIONING TEMPERATURE SWITCH AND A TEMPERATURE TRANSMITTER THAT HAD NOT BEEN PROGRAMMED TO ACT AS A BACKUP TO THE TEMPERATURE SWITCH, THE CONTROL SYSTEM DID NOT STOP THE FLOW OF LNG THROUGH THE VAPORIZER, UPON A LOW GAS TEMPERATURE ON THE OUTLET OF THE VAPORIZER.  THE BOILER ATTEMPTED TO FIRE ABOUT THREE MINUTES AFTER THE LNG FLOW RESUMED BUT FAILED TO STAY RUNNING.  THE SYSTEM ATTEMPTED TO START A BACK-UP BOILER ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATER, ABOUT WHEN THE DISTRIBUTION LINE RUPTURED.  THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES WILL BE REVISED TO NO LONGER ALLOW CONTROL CHANGES FROM VIA REMOTE CONTROL (EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCY SHUT DOWNS AND SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS) AND INSTEAD REQUIRE THE MONITORING OPERATOR TO TRAVEL TO THE SITE TO MAKE THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS AND CHANGES.

AT 1528 HRS, THE DCS OPERATOR INITIATED A MANUAL EMERGENCY SHUT DOWN (ESD) OF TRAIN 1. ON-SITE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 1535 HRS WHERE A FLUCTUATING ORANGE FLAME WAS OBSERVED ON THE INLET FLANGE TO THE THERMAL OXIDIZER KNOCK OUT DRUM 11V-1904. AT 1539 HRS THE MUSTER ALARM WAS SOUNDED. THE FLAME WAS CONTAINED AND EXTINGUISHED UTILIZING WATER SPRAY FROM AREA FIRE MONITORS AT APPROXIMATELY 1550 HRS. AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS NO THREAT TO ADJACENT EQUIPMENT OR PIPING. NEARBY EQUIPMENT WAS KEPT COOL USING WATER SPRAY. THE SUBSEQUENT ALL CLEAR WAS PROVIDED AT 1557 HRS.

THE FLARE VALVE WAS LEFT IN AUTO WITH A SET-POINT OF 3.0 PSIG TO CONTINUE CONTROLLING TANK PRESSURES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE DURING THE STORM. DURING THE STORM, POWER WAS LOST TO THE FACILITY, CAUSING THE DIESEL STANDBY GENERATOR TO START. EVENTUALLY THE GENERATOR RAN OUT OF FUEL AND SHUT DOWN BECAUSE PERSONNEL WERE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE SITE AS A DIRECT RESULT OF DAMAGE TO THE SURROUNDING AREA CAUSED BY HURRICANE LAURA, WHICH CAUSED THE INSTRUMENT AIR COMPRESSORS TO SHUT DOWN, CAUSING LOSS OF INSTRUMENT AIR. THIS CAUSED THE CONTROL VALVES TO GO TO THEIR FAIL SAFE POSITION, WHICH IS FAIL CLOSE FOR THE FLARE VALVE. AT THAT POINT, TANK PRESSURES STARTED CLIMBING UNTIL THE PSV ON T-202 LIFTED PER DESIGN TO CONTROL THE TANK PRESSURES.

THE COMPRESSOR WAS OPERATING AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE. SLNG OPERATORS EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE WITHIN 10 MINUTES, USING ON-SITE FIREWATER MONITORS. SLNG CALLED 911; THE SAVANNAH FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON-SCENE AFTER THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED.     UPON NOTIFICATION OF THE FIRE, THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR FOR MMLS US02 ACTIVATED THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN DEVICE (ESD) FOR MMLS US02 AT 13:38. AT 13:44, THE MIXED REFRIGERANT (MR) SYSTEM WAS DEPRESSURIZED AND ANY REMAINING MR WAS SENT TO THE GROUND FLARE.    THE INCIDENT RESULTED IN NO EVACUATIONS, FROM EITHER THE FACILITY OR THE PUBLIC.     THE PRODUCTS INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WERE MOBIL DTE 846 TURBINE OIL AND MR. THE MR IS A MIXTURE OF ISOPENTANE, NITROGEN, METHANE, PROPANE, AND ETHYLENE. THE REFRIGERANT MIXTURE EITHER WAS CONSUMED IN THE FIRE OR WAS SENT TO THE FLARE ONCE THE MR SYSTEM WAS DEPRESSURIZED. SLNG ESTIMATES THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MR RELEASE IS 6,750 POUNDS (APPROXIMATELY 84 MCF). IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 10 MCF OF MR WAS RELEASED AND BURNED IN THE FIRE AND AN ESTIMATED 74 MCF OF MR WAS SENT TO THE FLARE WHEN THE UNIT WAS DEPRESSURIZED. THE RELEASE OF MR CAUSED NO ACUTE CHRONIC EXPOSURES TO PERSONNEL OR TO THE ENVIRONMENT.    SOME TURBINE OIL WAS RELEASED TO THE GROUND.

THE CRACK WAS IDENTIFIED DIRECTLY BELOW THE EXISTING LNG PUMP CATWALK/PLATFORM AND APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT ABOVE THE DOME LIP/COMPRESSION EDGE. THE OPERATOR ON DUTY NOTIFIED MANAGEMENT OF A POTENTIAL LEAK ON TOP OF THE LNG STORAGE AS EVIDENCED BY A VAPOR CLOUD. PLANT MANAGEMENT INFORMED THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC OF THIS POTENTIAL ISSUE AND REQUESTED THAT HE INVESTIGATE IT IMMEDIATELY. THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE AS REQUESTED AND INFORMED THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS THAT IT APPEARED THERE WAS A CRACK IN THE EXTERIOR TANK SHELL. THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS INSTRUCTED THE OPERATOR ON DUTY AND THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC TO SHUTDOWN THE LIQUEFACTION AND TRAILER LOADING ACTIVITIES UNTIL ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COULD TAKE PLACE. THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AND LNG PLANT ENGINEER VISITED THE SITE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE NOTIFICATION BY THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC TO CONFIRM THE FINDINGS. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT A CRACK HAD OCCURRED IN THE CARBON STEEL OUTER TANK AT A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5 FEET. APPROXIMATELY 4 TO 5 YEARS AGO, WITH THE FACILITY UNDER PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP, A LEAK IN AN LNG LIQUID VALVE OCCURRED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE LOCATION OF FAILURE CAUSING DISCOLORATION IN THIS AREA. IN ADDITION, KINETREX ENERGY REPLACED THIS VALVE IN OCTOBER 2019 AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR FACILITY. AFTER THE VALVE REPLACEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT COOLDOWN OF THE LINE, THE KINETREX ENERGY PLANT MECHANICS VERIFIED TIGHTNESS OF THE NEWLY INSTALLED VALVE AND NOTATED A SMALL LNG LEAK (A COUPLE OF DROPS/MINUTE) LANDING IN THE EXISTING LNG DRIP PAN PRIOR TO RECTIFYING THIS LEAK. THIS LEAK WAS STOPPED AT THIS TIME. WITH THE DISCOLORATION IT IS PRESUMED THE CARBON STEEL OUTER TANK'S INTEGRITY WAS PREVIOUSLY IMPACTED ULTIMATELY LEADING TO THE FAILURE IN 2019. KINETREX ENERGY BEGAN THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING VARIOUS ENGINEERING FIRMS WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, AS WELL AS, MATRIX PDM, THE ORIGINAL TANK MANUFACTURER. MATRIX PDM RECOMMENDED THAT KINETREX ENERGY USE AN EPOXY (BELZONA PRODUCT) TO TEMPORARILY STOP THE LEAK. THE LEAK WAS STOPPED THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 7, 2019 WITH BOIL-OFF GAS NORMAL OPERATION RESUMING. THE INDIANA UTILITY REGULATORY COMMISSION AND A PHMSA REPRESENTATIVE VISITED THE SITE ON NOVEMBER 14, 2019 TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT. SINCE THIS LEAK WAS DISCOVERED, KINETREX ENERGY HAS CONTRACTED WITH MATRIX PDM TO CONDUCT A PHASE I ENGINEERING STUDY. THE ENGINEERING STUDY WILL INCLUDE RECOMMENDATION(S), COST(S), AND SCHEDULE TO TEST AND PERMANENTLY REPAIR THE CRACK. THIS REPORT IS EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED BY MATRIX PDM WITHIN 4 WEEKS. MATRIX PDM HAS SINCE COMPLETED A PHASE I AND II ENGINEERING STUDY OUTLINING THE PROPOSED DESIGN TO PERMANENTLY REPAIR THE CRACK. MATERIAL HAS BEEN PROCURED FOR THIS REPAIR AND IS CURRENTLY ON STANDBY WHILE KINETREX ENERGY BOILS OFF THE REMAINING INVENTORY TO PURGE THE TANK OUT OF SERVICE WITH N2. THE TANK N2 AND AIR PURGE OUT OF SERVICE PROCESS COMPLETED ON OCTOBER 12, 2020 WITH CONSTRUCTION COMMENCING IMMEDIATELY AFTER ON OCTOBER 13, 2020 WITH A COMPLETION DATE OF OCTOBER 22, 2020.

TWO VAPORIZERS WERE RUNNING AT THE TIME, 50 MMSCFD EACH, AND SHUT DOWN DUE TO THE LOSS OF COMMUNICATION.  IT WAS FOUND THAT THE OUTLETS OF THE VAPORIZERS GOING INTO PIPELINE WERE GETTING EXTREMELY COLD. THE ESD VALVES DID NOT SHUT AUTOMATICALLY WHICH COULD HAVE ALLOWED LNG INTO THE PIPELINE.  THE TEAM THEN SAW THAT THE LNG PUMPS DID NOT SHUT OFF AND WERE STILL RUNNING.  THE MANUAL VALVES ON THE VAPORIZERS WERE SHUT IN TO ENSURE NO LNG WOULD GET INTO THE PIPELINE.  AT 2250 THE A AND C LNG PUMP EMERGENCY-STOP BUTTONS WERE PUSHED.  THE TEAM PROCEEDED TO BYPASS FIRE AND GAS AND START A BLOW DOWN OF THE VAPORIZERS, TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF LNG GETTING INTO THE CARBON STEEL PIPING OF PIPELINE.  THE FIRE AND GAS IS BYPASSED TO PREVENT AN UNEXPECTED ESD. WHILE THE VAPORIZERS WERE BLOWING DOWN A PILOT RELIEF VALVE BLEW INSIDE THE VAPORIZER BUILDING.  THE PILOT RELIEF IS VERY NEAR A GAS DETECTOR HEAD. THE TEAM MEMBER IN THE CONTROL ROOM ANNOUNCED OVER RADIO THAT EVERYONE NEEDED TO GET IN THE CONTROL ROOM.  THE ESD BUTTON WAS THEN MANUALLY PUSHED AT 2339.    AFTER THE VAPORIZERS WERE BLOWN DOWN, THE PLC CABINET WAS OPENED AND THE ETHERNET SWITCH (NNG-GARN-CTRLS-SW-G) WAS FOUND TO BE COVERED IN WATER.

THE EVENT HAPPENED WHILE O&M PERSONNEL WAS WORKING IN THE REPLACEMENT OF LNG PUMP P-101C. WHILE THE PUMP WAS BEING REMOVED FROM THE TANK COLUMN AND TRAVELING TO ITS TRANSPORTATION FRAME, SUPPORTED BY THE LNG TANK TOP CRANE, O&M PERSONNEL NOTICED A SMALL FIRE IN THE BOTTOM SUCTION NOTCH OF THE PUMP. IMMEDIATELY, ECOELECTRICA MAINTENANCE TECHNICIANS PROCEEDED TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE USING PORTABLE ABC FIRE EXTINGUISHERS LOCATED AT THE LNG TANK TOP PLATFORM. NO PERSONNEL WAS INJURED OR EQUIPMENT DAMAGED DURING THE INCIDENT. AT 15:37HRS (TWO MINUTES LATER), A LNG SENDOUT PUMP WAS RETURNED TO OPERATION AND AT 15:41HRS LNG VAPORIZATION PROCESS WAS REESTABLISHED AND TERMINAL RECOVERED FOR NORMAL OPERATION.     THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE IGNITION WAS A STATIC ELECTRICITY DISCHARGE. AFTER A NITROGEN PURGE OF MORE THAN 12 HOURS, THE PUMP WAS READY TO BE REMOVED FROM ITS WELL. DUE TO STRONG GUST OF WINDS, PRIOR TO LIFTING  THE PUMP, A POLYPROPYLENE ROPE WAS TIED TO ONE OF THE STANDS OF THE BOTTOM SUCTION NOTCH AS AN AID TO CONTROL PUMP MOVEMENTS WHILE BEING TRANSFERRED FROM THE WELL TO THE TRANSPORTATION FRAME. DURING THIS MANEUVER THE TECHNICIAN ATTENDING THE PUMP WAS USING SKIN GLOVES WHILE THE PROPYLENE ROPE WAS BEING CONTROLLED WITH HIS HANDS CREATING FRICTION BETWEEN THE TWO MATERIALS. THE GLOVES' MATERIAL (LEATHER) IN CONTACT WITH THE ROPE (POLYPROPYLENE) GAVE RISE TO ACCUMULATIONS OF ELECTRIC CHARGE THAT WAS RELEASED SUDDENLY IN ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGES WITH SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO IGNITE THE FLAMMABLE GAS MIX PRESENT AT THE PUMP NOTCH. THE FIRST STEP ON THE IGNITION IS THE PRODUCTION OF A SPARK THAT INSTANTLY GENERATES IR LIGHT (CORONA EFFECT) THAT WAS CAPTURED BY THE FLAME DETECTOR WHICH TRIGGERED THE ESD #1."

INFORMATION INDICATES THE CAUSE OF THE FLASH FIRE WAS A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF A FUEL RUN REGULATOR LOCATED ON THE VAPORIZER TRAILER. THE REGULATOR FAILURE CAUSED MULTIPLE RELIEF VALVES TO EXHAUST GAS TO THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS IGNITED BY THE WATER/GLYCOL HEATER BURNERS LOCATED ON THE VAPORIZER TRAILER. TWO EMPLOYEES WERE EXAMINED AT A NEARBY HOSPITAL AND RELEASED BACK TO FULL DUTY. THEY BOTH HAD SUNBURN LIKE INJURIES.    NORTHERN HAD PLACED THIS TEMPORARY / PORTABLE LNG TANKER AND VAPORIZER TAILER AT THE BENSON, MINNESOTA TOWN BORDER STATION AS A CONTINGENCY WHILE WORK WAS BEING CONDUCTED UPSTREAM AT THE ALEXANDRIA, MINNESOTA COMPRESSOR STATION. THE TANKER AND VAPORIZER HAD BEEN CONNECTED TO THE BENSON TOWN BORDER STATION SINCE 12/27/2013 BUT WASN'T IN-SERVICE UNTIL THE MORNING OF 12/31/2013. THE WATER BATH HEATERS ON THE VAPORIZER TRAILER WERE LIT BUT LNG WAS NOT BEING DELIVERED. ON 12/31/2013, THE PIPELINE GAS PRESSURE WAS LOW ENOUGH TO TEST THE LNG DELIVERY. THE DELIVERY WAS JUST BEGINNING TO COME ON WHEN THE REGULATOR FAILED AND THE FLASH FIRE OCCURRED. THE TOWN OF BENSON, MINNESOTA WAS NEVER IN DANGER OF LOSING NATURAL GAS SERVICE."

THE PLANT WAS OPERATING IN LIQUEFACTION MODE AND EXPERIENCED AN UNPLANNED SHUTDOWN OF ITS LIQUEFACTION PROCESS.  ON-SITE PERSONNEL RESPONDED APPROPRIATELY AND RETURNED THE PLANT TO HOLD MODE AND VERIFIED SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE WAS A SMALL CYCLING RELEASE OF CO2 FROM A VESSEL THROUGH ITS RELIEF VALVE FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 20 MINUTES.  FURTHER RESEARCH OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS CONFIRMED THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVENT AS THE FAILURE OF AN ALLEN-BRADLEY PLC-5/40E PROCESSOR BOARD.  THIS PLC WAS PROGRAMMED AS THE CONTROL PLC FOR THE PLANT LIQUEFACTION PROCESS.  A REPLACEMENT PLC WAS PROCURED AND DELIVERED TO THE PLANT ON WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 7, 2012.  THE LIQUEFACTION PLC PROGRAM WAS RELOADED INTO THE NEW PROCESSOR AND ITS FUNCTIONALITY WAS VERIFIED THAT SAME DAY.  THE PLANT WAS DECLARED BACK IN SERVICE BY NOON WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 7, 2012."
