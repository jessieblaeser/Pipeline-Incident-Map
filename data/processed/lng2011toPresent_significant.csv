THE CRACK WAS IDENTIFIED DIRECTLY BELOW THE EXISTING LNG PUMP CATWALK/PLATFORM AND APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT ABOVE THE DOME LIP/COMPRESSION EDGE. THE OPERATOR ON DUTY NOTIFIED MANAGEMENT OF A POTENTIAL LEAK ON TOP OF THE LNG STORAGE AS EVIDENCED BY A VAPOR CLOUD. PLANT MANAGEMENT INFORMED THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC OF THIS POTENTIAL ISSUE AND REQUESTED THAT HE INVESTIGATE IT IMMEDIATELY. THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE AS REQUESTED AND INFORMED THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS THAT IT APPEARED THERE WAS A CRACK IN THE EXTERIOR TANK SHELL. THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS INSTRUCTED THE OPERATOR ON DUTY AND THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC TO SHUTDOWN THE LIQUEFACTION AND TRAILER LOADING ACTIVITIES UNTIL ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COULD TAKE PLACE. THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AND LNG PLANT ENGINEER VISITED THE SITE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE NOTIFICATION BY THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC TO CONFIRM THE FINDINGS. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT A CRACK HAD OCCURRED IN THE CARBON STEEL OUTER TANK AT A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5 FEET. APPROXIMATELY 4 TO 5 YEARS AGO, WITH THE FACILITY UNDER PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP, A LEAK IN AN LNG LIQUID VALVE OCCURRED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE LOCATION OF FAILURE CAUSING DISCOLORATION IN THIS AREA. IN ADDITION, KINETREX ENERGY REPLACED THIS VALVE IN OCTOBER 2019 AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR FACILITY. AFTER THE VALVE REPLACEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT COOLDOWN OF THE LINE, THE KINETREX ENERGY PLANT MECHANICS VERIFIED TIGHTNESS OF THE NEWLY INSTALLED VALVE AND NOTATED A SMALL LNG LEAK (A COUPLE OF DROPS/MINUTE) LANDING IN THE EXISTING LNG DRIP PAN PRIOR TO RECTIFYING THIS LEAK. THIS LEAK WAS STOPPED AT THIS TIME. WITH THE DISCOLORATION IT IS PRESUMED THE CARBON STEEL OUTER TANK'S INTEGRITY WAS PREVIOUSLY IMPACTED ULTIMATELY LEADING TO THE FAILURE IN 2019. KINETREX ENERGY BEGAN THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING VARIOUS ENGINEERING FIRMS WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, AS WELL AS, MATRIX PDM, THE ORIGINAL TANK MANUFACTURER. MATRIX PDM RECOMMENDED THAT KINETREX ENERGY USE AN EPOXY (BELZONA PRODUCT) TO TEMPORARILY STOP THE LEAK. THE LEAK WAS STOPPED THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 7, 2019 WITH BOIL-OFF GAS NORMAL OPERATION RESUMING. THE INDIANA UTILITY REGULATORY COMMISSION AND A PHMSA REPRESENTATIVE VISITED THE SITE ON NOVEMBER 14, 2019 TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT. SINCE THIS LEAK WAS DISCOVERED, KINETREX ENERGY HAS CONTRACTED WITH MATRIX PDM TO CONDUCT A PHASE I ENGINEERING STUDY. THE ENGINEERING STUDY WILL INCLUDE RECOMMENDATION(S), COST(S), AND SCHEDULE TO TEST AND PERMANENTLY REPAIR THE CRACK. THIS REPORT IS EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED BY MATRIX PDM WITHIN 4 WEEKS. MATRIX PDM HAS SINCE COMPLETED A PHASE I AND II ENGINEERING STUDY OUTLINING THE PROPOSED DESIGN TO PERMANENTLY REPAIR THE CRACK. MATERIAL HAS BEEN PROCURED FOR THIS REPAIR AND IS CURRENTLY ON STANDBY WHILE KINETREX ENERGY BOILS OFF THE REMAINING INVENTORY TO PURGE THE TANK OUT OF SERVICE WITH N2. THE TANK N2 AND AIR PURGE OUT OF SERVICE PROCESS COMPLETED ON OCTOBER 12, 2020 WITH CONSTRUCTION COMMENCING IMMEDIATELY AFTER ON OCTOBER 13, 2020 WITH A COMPLETION DATE OF OCTOBER 22, 2020. ALL QA/QC MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO ENSURE THE WELD OF THE TANK WAS SATISFACTORY INCLUDING A PRESSURE TEST OF THE AREA. THE N2 AND NATURAL GAS PURGE INTO SERVICE ACTIVITIES STARTED ON OCTOBER 23, 2020 AND WERE COMPLETE ON NOVEMBER 3, 2020.

THE COMPRESSOR WAS OPERATING AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE. SLNG OPERATORS EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE WITHIN 10 MINUTES, USING ON-SITE FIREWATER MONITORS. SLNG CALLED 911; THE SAVANNAH FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON-SCENE AFTER THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED.     UPON NOTIFICATION OF THE FIRE, THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR FOR MMLS US02 ACTIVATED THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN DEVICE (ESD) FOR MMLS US02 AT 13:38. AT 13:44, THE MIXED REFRIGERANT (MR) SYSTEM WAS DEPRESSURIZED AND ANY REMAINING MR WAS SENT TO THE GROUND FLARE.

THE MR IS A MIXTURE OF ISOPENTANE, NITROGEN, METHANE, PROPANE, AND ETHYLENE. THE REFRIGERANT MIXTURE EITHER WAS CONSUMED IN THE FIRE OR WAS SENT TO THE FLARE ONCE THE MR SYSTEM WAS DEPRESSURIZED. SLNG ESTIMATES THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MR RELEASE IS 6,750 POUNDS (APPROXIMATELY 84 MCF). IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 10 MCF OF MR WAS RELEASED AND BURNED IN THE FIRE AND AN ESTIMATED 74 MCF OF MR WAS SENT TO THE FLARE WHEN THE UNIT WAS DEPRESSURIZED. THE RELEASE OF MR CAUSED NO ACUTE CHRONIC EXPOSURES TO PERSONNEL OR TO THE ENVIRONMENT.    SOME TURBINE OIL WAS RELEASED TO THE GROUND. THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF TURBINE OIL RELEASED TO THE GROUND IS 150 GALLONS. NO WATERWAYS OR DRAINS WERE IMPACTED. THE FIREWATER AND OIL MIXTURE WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE DESIGNED FACILITY IMPOUNDMENTS. MORAN ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT AND BEGAN CLEAN-UP ACTIVITIES OF THE OIL ON THE EVENING OF THE INCIDENT.       SLNG HAS RETAINED EXPONENT ENGINEERING AND SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING TO ASSUME THE LEAD IN THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. EXPONENT WILL BE PROVIDING THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS INVESTIGATION REPORT."

ON OCTOBER 11TH, AT APPROXIMATELY 1527 HRS, SMOKE WAS OBSERVED NEAR THE TRAIN 1 THERMAL OXIDIZER KO DRUM 11V-1904 BY A FIELD OPERATOR CONDUCTING OPERATOR ROUNDS. AT 1528 HRS, THE DCS OPERATOR INITIATED A MANUAL EMERGENCY SHUT DOWN (ESD) OF TRAIN 1. ON-SITE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 1535 HRS WHERE A FLUCTUATING ORANGE FLAME WAS OBSERVED ON THE INLET FLANGE TO THE THERMAL OXIDIZER KNOCK OUT DRUM 11V-1904. AT 1539 HRS THE MUSTER ALARM WAS SOUNDED. THE FLAME WAS CONTAINED AND EXTINGUISHED UTILIZING WATER SPRAY FROM AREA FIRE MONITORS AT APPROXIMATELY 1550 HRS. AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS NO THREAT TO ADJACENT EQUIPMENT OR PIPING. NEARBY EQUIPMENT WAS KEPT COOL USING WATER SPRAY. THE SUBSEQUENT ALL CLEAR WAS PROVIDED AT 1557 HRS.    AS AN ESD WAS INITIATED, AN IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS MADE AT 1603 ON OCTOBER 11TH, 2020, NRC REPORT # 1289503. THROUGH COORDINATION WITH BOTH PHMSA AND FERC, SABINE PASS SUPPORTED MULTIPLE VISITS AND DATA REQUESTS AND RETURNED TRAIN 1 TO SERVICE ON OCTOBER 24, 2020 WITH THE THERMAL OXIDIZER ISOLATED UNDER A DOCUMENTED TEMPORARY MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE PROCESS.    STATUS AS OF 4/28/2021: THE THERMAL OXIDIZER 11V-1904 REMAINS OUT OF SERVICE UNDER THAT TEMPORARY MOC PENDING A FITNESS FOR SERVICE REPORT AND AN OPERATIONAL WINDOW TO RETURN IT TO SERVICE DURING AN OUTAGE. INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS WERE CONDUCTED BY AN INDEPENDENT 3RD PARTY AND CHENIERE. THESE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION REPORTS WERE PROVIDED TO PHMSA SW REGION ON APR 2, 2021. THE CAUSE WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED HAZARD, THE REVERSE FLOW OF HOT FLUE GAS FROM THE THERMAL OXIDIZER. HAZARD RECURRENCE WAS MITIGATED BY ADDING INTERLOCKS TO PREVENT BACK-FLOW FROM THE THERMAL OXIDIZER TO THE KNOCKOUT DRUM. A FITNESS-FOR-SERVICE EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED ON ALL AFFECTED COMPONENTS. WHERE APPROPRIATE, REPAIRS WERE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN PIPING AND VALVES WERE REBUILT OR REPLACED OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION.

THE NON-HAZARDOUS LEAK IS UNDER A STEEL BACKING PLATE THAT IS WELDED TO THE ROOF OF THE LNG TANK. THE BACKING PLATE IS PART OF THE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE WALKING PLATFORM. BECAUSE THE BACKING PLATE IS NOT FULLY WELDED, WATER ACCUMULATED BETWEEN THE BACKING PLATE AND THE LNG TANK ROOF, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO A NON-HAZARDOUS CORROSION LEAK. AN ESTIMATED 300 CFH IS VENTING TO THE ATMOSPHERE.    INTERMOUNTAIN GAS COMPANY (IGC) HIRED AN ENGINEERING CONSULTANT ON FEBRUARY 11, 2021 TO EVALUATE REPAIR OPTIONS. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2021 AT 11:10 A.M. MST, USING DATA PROVIDED BY THE ENGINEERING CONSULTANT, IGC DETERMINED THE LNG TANK WILL BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE TO MAKE REPAIRS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED $50,000, AT WHICH TIME IGC NOTIFIED THE NRC.      AS OF FEBRUARY 17, 2021, THE LNG TANK HAD 3,093,114 GALLONS OF LNG. TO ALLOW FOR THE OFFLOAD AND VAPORIZATION OF THE LNG, THE LNG TANK WILL BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE IN JUNE 2021.    THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF COMMODITY RELEASED UNINTENTIONALLY (PART A, QUESTION 9) IS 201.6 MCF AS OF MARCH 4, 2021. THIS QUANTITY WILL BE REVISED FOR THE FINAL REPORT.    ESTIMATED COST OF OPERATOR'S PROPERTY DAMAGE & REPAIRS (PART C, QUESTION 1.B.) IS $500,000. THIS COST WILL BE REVISED FOR THE FINAL REPORT.    INTERMOUNTAIN GAS COMPANY RECEIVED A QUOTE FOR REPAIRS ON JUNE 23, 2021. THE OPERATOR'S PROPERTY DAMAGE & REPAIRS (PART C, QUESTION 1.B.) HAS BEEN REVISED FROM $500,000 TO $1,989,000."
