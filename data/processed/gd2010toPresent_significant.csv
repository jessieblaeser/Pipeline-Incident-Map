CENTERVILLE IS LOCATED IN APPANOOSE COUNTY.  CONDITIONS THAT MORNING WERE CLEAR AND SUNNY WITH TEMPERATURES AROUND 65 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.     AT APPROXIMATELY 8:48 AM CST, INTERSTATE POWER & LIGHT'S (IPL) DISTRIBUTION DISPATCH CENTER IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IA RECEIVED A CALL FROM EMPLOYEES IN IPL'S CENTERVILLE CALL CENTER WITH A REPORT OF AN ELECTRICAL OUTAGE AND A HOUSE FIRE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CALL CENTER BUILDING.  AN ELECTRIC LINEMAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:05 AM, A CALL ALSO CAME IN FROM THE CENTERVILLE POLICE/FIRE DISPATCHER REPORTING A HOUSE FIRE. WHEN THE IPL LINEMAN ARRIVED ONSITE AT 9:20 AM, THE VALVE AT THE GAS METER SET HAD BEEN SHUT OFF BY FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL.  AT THIS POINT, THE SITUATION APPEARED TO BE A HOUSE FIRE CAUSED BY A SQUIRREL MAKING CONTACT WITH AN ENERGIZED SWITCH ON A POLE AT THE REAR OF 1202 DRAKE AVENUE, WHICH RESULTED IN A FAULT AND BREAKER OPERATIONS THAT INTRODUCED HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRICITY INTO THE HOME'S ELECTRICAL WIRING SYSTEM.       AT APPROXIMATELY 9:25 AM, DURING FIREFIGHTING ACTIVITIES, A ""WHOOSH"" OR ""FLASH"" OCCURRED, INDICATING AN IGNITION OF GAS.  AT THIS POINT, FLAMES ALSO APPEARED ALONG THE GROUND NEAR THE HOUSE.  GAS EMPLOYEES ARRIVED ON SITE AT 9:32 AM.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:25 AM, GAS TO THE RESIDENCE WAS SHUT OFF BY EXCAVATING OVER THE SERVICE TAP AND OPERATING THE EXISTING SERVICE TEE.    SIX FIREFIGHTERS SOUGHT MEDICAL TREATMENT DUE TO THE GAS IGNITION.  THREE OF THEM WERE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR OVERNIGHT OBSERVATION AND RELEASED THE NEXT DAY.     AN IOWA UTILITIES BOARD INVESTIGATOR, ALONG WITH A STATE FIRE INVESTIGATOR, VISITED THE SITE ON THE AFTERNOON OF MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 AND WITNESSED THE EXCAVATION AND REMOVAL OF A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE LINE.  INITIAL INDICATIONS ARE THAT AN ELECTRICAL ARC BETWEEN THE ELECTRICAL SERVICE LINE CONDUIT AND THE STEEL GAS SERVICE BURNED A HOLE IN BOTH, ALLOWING GAS TO MIGRATE INTO THE ALREADY BURNING STRUCTURE VIA THE CONDUIT AND INTO THE ELECTRIC SERVICE PANEL.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE EXISTING FIRE IN THE STRUCTURE.     THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TELEPHONICALLY TO KEVIN WILLIAMS OF THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT APPROXIMATELY 10:01 CST ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 BY JIM HOUSE, MANAGER GAS DISTRIBUTION AND METERING. (CASE #955252)  THE INCIDENT WAS NOT REPORTED ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2010, BECAUSE IT WAS REPORTED TO MR. HOUSE AS A HOUSE FIRE THAT WAS LATER FED BY NATURAL GAS. THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF AN EXPLOSIVE OR VIOLENT GAS IGNITION.  AFTER READING THE NEWS ACCOUNTS ON MONDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 DESCRIBING IT AS A GAS EXPLOSION, MR. HOUSE IMMEDIATELY MADE THE TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.  IN MR. HOUSE'S FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. LOPEZ FROM THE PHMSA OFFICE IN HOUSTON, MR.

DISTRICT STATION, R-316, CONTINUES TO BE OUT OF COMMISSION. A TEMPORARY REGULATOR STATION HAS BEEN INSTALLED TO ENSURE SAFE, RELIABLE SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS DURING WINTER OPERATIONS.   CURRENTLY SERVICE HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ALL CUSTOMERS.     COLUMBIA'S CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS FIRE WAS THE RESULT OF A CROSS ARM FAILURE FROM OUR ELECTRICAL PROVIDER'S NEARBY POWER POLE.  THE HIGH VOLTAGE PRIMARY CONDUCTORS (LINES) FELL INTO THE SECONDARY ELECTRICAL DROP SERVING COLUMBIA'S REGULATOR STATION BUILDING AND ENERGIZED THE NEUTRAL TO 7200 VOLTS.  THIS RESULTED IN A FAULT CURRENT THAT TRAVELED VIA ALL AVAILABLE GROUND PATHS TO STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES LOCATED INSIDE THE STATION.  THE SUBSEQUENT ELECTRICAL ARCING RESULTED IN HOLES BEING BURNED IN THE STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES WHICH RELEASED GAS THAT WAS IGNITED BY THE ELECTRICAL ARCING, RESULTING IN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THIS FIRE.      ONCE THE GAS-FED FIRE IGNITED WITHIN THE REGULATOR STATION FROM THE ELECTRICALLY DAMAGED STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES AND CONTROL BOX, THE FIRE FROM THE CONTROL LINES BURNED THE GASKETS OUT OF THE LARGE DIAMETER PIPE FLANGES AND A MUCH LARGER FIRE  ENSUED FED BY THE 130 PSIG GAS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH EYE WITNESS ACCOUNTS THAT THE FIRE THAT DAMAGED THE REGULATOR BUILDING DID NOT START UNTIL 20 TO 30 MINUTES AFTER THE POWER LINES CAME DOWN"

THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN IN THE VICINITY OF THE MANHOLE WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A LAB FOR TESTING AND INSPECTION.   THE TESTS DISCOVERED A CRACK IN THE PIPE APPROXIMATELY A HALF-BLOCK AWAY FROM THE MANHOLE.  THE CRACK WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE EXTERNAL LOADING FROM PASSING VEHICLES.

ADDITIONALLY, AN OPEN-ENDED SECTION OF THE CUSTOMER FUEL LINE TERMINATING ON THE SECOND FLOOR WAS FOUND.

AROUND THIS SAME TIME, A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (GSR) OBSERVED SMOKE WHILE DRIVING NEARBY AND WENT TO THE SCENE.  THE GSR OBSERVED A HOUSE STRUCTURE ON FIRE AS WELL AS FLAMES IN THE LANDSCAPE AREA IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.  THE HOMEOWNER INDICATED SHE NOTICED THE SMELL OF GAS AT APPROXIMATELY 0800 HOURS THAT MORNING BUT DID NOT THINK MUCH ABOUT IT AND LEFT HER RESIDENCE AT APPROXIMATELY 1130 HOURS.  THE HOMEOWNER DID NOT NOTIFY PG&E OF THE OBSERVED SMELL OF GAS.  A GAS CONSTRUCTION CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1251 HOURS, AND THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED BY EXCAVATING AND SQUEEZING THE PLASTIC MAIN AT THREE LOCATIONS. GAS SERVICE WAS INTERRUPTED TO SEVEN CUSTOMERS.  SERVICE TO ONE AFFECTED RESIDENCE WAS RESTORED WHEN STRUCTURE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED.  SERVICE TO THE REMAINING SIX CUSTOMERS WERE RESTORED BY 1400 HOURS ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2011.  EXCAVATION OF THE PLASTIC GAS DISTRIBUTION MAIN REVEALED A CRACK IN A 2-INCH ALDYL A PLASTIC TEE, WHICH WAS THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK.  THE TEE FAILED AS A RESULT OF STRESS RISERS FORMED IN THE TEE MATERIAL FROM THE STEPWISE INCREASE IN WALL THICKNESS WHERE THE COUPLING AND SERVICE PIPE FIRST BOND.  THE FRACTURE PROPOGATED BY SLOW CRACK GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE SYSTEM PRESSURE.  GAS FROM THE LEAKING TEE MIGRATED UNDERGROUND TO THE GARAGE OF THE RESIDENCE AND CAUGHT FIRE FROM THE PILOT LIGHT OF THE FURNACE IN THE GARAGE. PG&E CONDUCTED LEAK SURVEYS AT THE 422 TOWNHOUSE COMPLEX WHERE 20299 NORTHWEST SQUARE IS LOCATED IN APRIL AND MAY OF 2011.  A REVIEW OF THE LEAK SURVEY RECORDS DID NOT REVEAL ANY ISSUES AT THIS RESIDENCE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE LEAKS DETECTED IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COMPLEX.  LEAK SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, AND SIX LEAKS WERE IDENTIFIED AND REPAIRED THROUGHOUT THE COMPLEX.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES.

THE CREW CONSISTED OF A DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER AND A SERVICE TECHNICIAN. THE CREW EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED A 6-INCH CAST IRON DISTRIBUTION MAIN OPERATING AT 5 PSIG.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER, WHILE WEARING A SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR, PREPARED THE CAST IRON MAIN FOR INSTALLATION OF A 6-INCH BY 9-INCHES IN LENGTH PIPE REPAIR CLAMP.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER INSTALLED THE CLAMP AND TIGHTENED THE BOLTS TO STOP THE LEAK.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER REMOVED THE SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. THEREAFTER, HE PROCEEDED TO FINISH TIGHTENING THE BOLTS AND SOAP CHECK THE PIPE TO VERIFY THAT THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.  AT THAT TIME, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN LEFT THE TOP OF THE EXCAVATION AND WENT TO THE TRUCK TO RETRIEVE COATING FOR THE REPAIR CLAMP WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF GAS BLOWING FROM THE EXCAVATION.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE EXCAVATION AND FOUND THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER KNEELING FACE DOWN OVER THE GAS MAIN AND UNRESPONSIVE TO VERBAL COMMANDS.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO AND CALLED 911.  GROSSE POINTE FARMS POLICE AND EMS PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND PULLED THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION; HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL IN DETROIT, MI WHERE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD.  A SECOND REPAIR CREW WAS CALLED IN TO REPAIR THE GAS MAIN FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND INSTALLED A 6-INCH BY 12-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP ADJACENT TO THE FIRST REPAIR CLAMP;  HOWEVER THE CLAMP FURTHER CRUSHED THE CORRODED/WEAKENED PIPE.   BOTH REPAIR CLAMPS WERE REMOVED AND A 6-INCH BY 30-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR THE LEAK.     ON NOVEMBER 1, 2011, THE PIPE WAS REMOVED AND RECOVERED FOR EXAMINATION AND A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS BY A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY.  THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT LOCALIZED GRAPHITIC CORROSION WEAKENED THE FRACTURED PIECES OF PIPE THAT WERE CRUSHED WHEN TIGHTENING THE REPAIR CLAMPS."

THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCEDURE WAS TO DISPOSE OF A BUILD-UP OF NATURAL GAS (DETERMINED LATER TO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN A MIXTURE OR AIR AND GAS) IN THE 22-INCH PIPELINE BY TRANSFERRING IT AT 10 PSIG INTO MICHCON'S GRAND RAPIDS/WALKER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM RATHER THAN RELEASING IT TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND FLARING (BURNING) THE GAS.  THE PROCEDURE WAS EXECUTED PRECISELY AS WRITTEN AND APPROVED BY MICHCON ENGINEERING.    AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 AM, WHILE THE PRESSURE REDUCTION PROCEDURE WAS STILL IN PROGRESS, MICHCON BEGAN TO RECEIVE ""NO-GAS"" REPORTS FROM CUSTOMERS SERVED BY THE SURROUNDING 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 AM, MICHCON PERSONNEL REALIZED THERE HAD BEEN AN AIR AND GAS MIXTURE IN THE 22-INCH PIPELINE, RATHER THAN GAS.  PRESSURE REDUCTION OPERATIONS WERE HALTED IMMEDIATELY.    MICHCON ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY CONVENED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED AREA AND THE SOURCE OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE.  MICHCON DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY 5500 CUSTOMERS OVER AN AREA OF ABOUT 10 SQUARE MILES COULD ULTIMATELY BE AFFECTED.  HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE INITIAL OUTAGE REPORTS AT 10:15 AM AND THE EARLY AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 17, THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 100 ""NO-GAS"" REPORTS.  THIS NUMBER GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 350 OUTAGE REPORTS BY 8 PM AS CUSTOMERS RETURNED HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY.  AT 8 PM MICHCON MANAGEMENT DECLARED THIS A ""SIGNIFICANT EVENT"" AND A TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.     CREWS WERE MOBILIZED FROM MICHCON REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN TO MAKE A DOOR-TO-DOOR INVESTIGATION OF EVERY CUSTOMER PREMISES IN THE AFFECTED AREA TO ENSURE THAT GAS SERVICE WAS BEING RESTORED AND THAT ALL APPLIANCES WERE OPERATING PROPERLY.  MICHCON ENGINEERS DEVELOPED A PLAN TO SYSTEMATICALLY PURGE THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE FROM THE 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, AND INDIVIDUAL SERVICE LINES WERE PURGED OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE WHEREVER IT WAS FOUND.  BY FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011, EVERY CUSTOMER HAD EITHER BEEN CONTACTED OR THEIR PREMISES WERE ENTERED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCKSMITHS TO CONFIRM THAT GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN RESTORED.  THERE WERE NO FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, OR INJURIES REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.    MICHCON HAS DETERMINED THE FORMATION OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE INSIDE THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF THE 22-INCH 238 PSIG PIPELINE BEGAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SEGMENT WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE DURING AUGUST 2011.  THE 22-INCH PIPELINE HAD BEEN SHUT IN BETWEEN MICHCON'S SOUTH GRAND RAPIDS GATE STATION TO THE WEST AND THE NEW COLLINDALE REGULATING STATION ON THE EAST END OF THE 22-INCH PIPELINE SEGMENT.  THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF PIPELINE HAD BEEN EVACUATED AND PURGED OF GAS, THEN CAPPED OFF AT THE COLLINDALE REGULATING STATION SITE WHILE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATION WAS COMPLETED.     A 22-INCH BLOCK VALVE AT THE SOUTH GRAND RAPIDS GATE STATION THAT WAS USED TO ISOLATE THE WEST END OF THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE ALLOWED GAS TO SLOWLY BLEED PAST THE VALVE SEAT, MIXING WITH THE AIR LEFT IN THE PURGED SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER 2011.  THE MICHCON ENGINEER WHO DEVELOPED THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE FOR OCTOBER 17 RECOGNIZED THAT THE GAS BLEEDING THROUGH THE 22-INCH BLOCK VALVE WAS CREATING A PRESSURE BUILD-UP, BUT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THIS WOULD CREATE AN AIR/GAS MIXTURE THAT WOULD BE UNFIT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO CUSTOMERS.    MICHCON HAS DETERMINED APPROXIMATELY 136,000 CUBIC FEET OF AN AIR/GAS MIXTURE HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE.

FRANCIS,DIRECTOR ENGINEERING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT,812-491-4369,jmfrancis@vectren.com,"ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 2011, AT 2:06 PM, VECTREN ENERGY DELIVERY OF OHIO WAS NOTIFIED BY THE CITY OF  FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT OF A HOUSE EXPLOSION AT 367/369 WAYNE DRIVE IN FAIRBORN.  VECTREN PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED THE VALVE TO THE SERVICE LINE PROVIDING NATURAL GAS TO THE STRUCTURE.     AN INITIAL REPORT FROM THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THE STRUCTURE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS 'TOTALLY DESTROYED AND REDUCED TO A FLAMING PILE OF RUBBLE'.  IT FURTHER DESCRIBED THE DAMAGE TO ADJACENT STRUCTURES INCLUDING BLOWN OUT WINDOWS, A COLLAPSED EXTERIOR WALL AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF FIRE TO THE ROOF LINES.     THE INITIAL REPORT ALSO COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE CAUSE REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION, THE PRELIMINARY THOUGHT IS THAT 'EXCAVATION WORK AROUND A NATURAL GAS LINE CAUSED THE LINE TO FRACTURE ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASEMENT WALL'' 'ALLOWING THE FREE FLOW OF GAS TO FILL THE INTERIOR OF THE STRUCTURE AND A UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE SPARKED THE EXPLOSION.'    VECTREN IS CONTINUING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN OF THIS INCIDENT.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT NARRATIVE, JANUARY 10, 2012:    THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE FOR THE DUPLEX AT 367-369 WAYNE DRIVE RAN UNDERGROUND FROM THE CURB BOX THROUGH THE CONCRETE BASEMENT WALL INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  AFTER GOING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE BASEMENT WALL, THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE THEN WENT TO THE LEFT AT A TEE CONNECTION TO THE METER FOR 367 WAYNE DRIVE AND THEN TO THE RIGHT AT AN NINETY DEGREE ELBOW THROUGH THE BLOCK WALL, DIVIDING THE BASEMENTS, TO THE METER FOR 369 WAYNE DRIVE.      VECTREN GENERALLY CONCLUDES THAT THE BACKHOE OPERATOR, DIGGING A TRENCH OUTSIDE THE BASEMENT FOUNDATION BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE DUPLEX, DAMAGED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE.  THIS DAMAGE CAUSED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE TO BEND AND PULL AND TO PLACE A LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE AND THE THREADS THAT SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW INSIDE THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THIS LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION CAUSED THE THREADS OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE, WHICH WERE SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW, TO FRACTURE AT THIS THREAD JOINT RELEASING NATURAL GAS INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THE NATURAL GAS EXPLODED FROM AN UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE ONCE THE NATURAL GAS AND AIR MIXTURE HAD REACHED A POINT BETWEEN THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT AND THE UPPER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.  THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION DID NOT CAUSE THE FRACTURE TO THIS THREAD JOINT.      VECTREN'S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF MERCAPTAN OR ODORANT WAS IN THE NATURAL GAS AT THE TIME AND THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER NATURAL GAS LEAKS.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND LEAK TIGHT.  VECTREN'S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO REQUESTS TO LOCATE THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE BEFORE THESE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS AND THAT THERE WAS NO REQUEST TO TURN OFF THE NATURAL GAS.  ALTHOUGH VECTREN DOES NOT RELY ON THE INITIAL REPORT OF THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE INCIDENT REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL, VECTREN'S CONCLUSIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THESE REPORTS."

MICHAEL CLARK OF THE RESIDENCE HAD JUST ENTERED HIS GARAGE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED, HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN SPECULATED THAT HE WAS ENTERING THE GARAGE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE.  TWO OTHER RESIDENTS WERE HOME AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE, DAKNEEKA PALMER, THE FIANCE OF MICHAEL CLARK, AND THEIR 9-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER, LEGACEE.  BOTH ESCAPED THE HOUSE UNHARMED.  THE ENERGY COOP WAS CONTACTED BY THE LICKING COUNTY 911 DISPATCHER AT 01:34 (5/14/12 - 1 HOUR 41 MINUTES AFTER THE EXPLOSION) TO RESPOND TO THE SITE TO ENSURE GAS WAS OFF TO THE STRUCTURE.  TWO ENERGY COOP EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHES, A LEAKAGE INSPECTOR MICHAEL CARR AND A SERVICE TECH TOM COOPER.  TOM ARRIVED 02:05 AND MIKE ARRIVED AT 02:20.  THEY VERIFIED GAS WAS OFF AND BEGAN A LEAKAGE INVESTIGATION.  AT 3:05, A LEAK WAS FOUND UNDER THE 20' WIDE APPROACH APRON OF THE DRIVEWAY AT 36 S. UTAH.  THE LEAKAGE EXTENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND THE DECISION TO SHUT THE MAIN DOWN ALONG WITH 8 CUSTOMERS WAS MADE.  THE VALVE TO SHUT THE LINE DOWN WAS TURNED AT 05:26 HOURS.  THE 2"" MAIN LINE SERVICING THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND CUT ON THE NORTH END AND SOUTH END OUTSIDE OF THE LEAKAGE AREA.  APPROXIMATELY 250' OF 2"" PLASTIC MAIN LINE WAS INSTALLED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF UTAH AVENUE.  THE NEW LINE WAS TIE BACK INTO THE EXISTING LINE IN A MANNER THAT ISOLATED THE GAS MAIN IN THE LEAKAGE AREA.  THE OLD LINE WAS CAPPED TO PRESERVE THE LINE FOR FURTHER TESTING.  GAS SERVICE WAS REESTABLISHED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  ODORANT READINGS WERE TAKEN AND FOUND TO BE WELL WITHIN REQUIRED LIMITS.  THE REMAINDER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SURVEYED FOR LEAKAGE TO ENSURE THE AREA WAS SAFE AS IT RELATED TO GAS SERVICE.  AT 09:00 ON MAY 16TH , 2012 WE RETURNED TO THE SITE TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE ISOLATED MAIN LINE AT NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE (43#) TO TEST FOR LEAKAGE.  WE FOUND LEAKAGE ON THE ISOLATED 191' OF 2"" BARE STEEL.  WE ISOLATED APPROXIMATELY 90' NORTH OF THE 36 S. UTAH DRIVEWAY AND PRESSURE TESTED IT.  WE FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE TESTED THE SOUTHERN SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 100') AND FOUND LEAKAGE.  WE EXCAVATED TO EXPOSE THE MAIN LINE JUST SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY TO 36 S. UTAH AND CUT THE MAIN TO ISOLATE APROXIMATELY 45' THAT WAS UNDER THE DRIVE WAY.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE 65'SECTION SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STRUCTURE AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  THIS ISOLATED THE LEAKAGE TO THE 45' SECTION LOCATED UNDER THE DRIVEWAY.  WE CUT THE CONCRETE AND PUT PRESSURE ON THE PIPING AND DETERMINED THERE WERE 2 LEAKAGE AREAS APPROXIMATELY 12' APPART UNDER THE EXISTING 20' CONCRETE DRIVEWAY."

THE FIRE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND NO FINAL REPORT HAS BEEN COMPLETED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE FIRE MARSHAL.    UPDATED FEBRUARY 11, 2013:  THIS UPDATE IS BASED PRIMARILY ON THE MINNESOTA STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S INVESTIGATION REPORT.  WE AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION IN THE REPORT THAT THE FIRE WAS ACCIDENTAL.  THE AREA OF ORIGIN FOR THE FIRE WAS INSIDE THE RESIDENCE.  THE FIRST MATERIAL THAT IGNITED WAS NATURAL GAS VAPORS THAT HAD LEECHED INTO THE RESIDENCE AFTER A GAS SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN CRACKED OR BROKEN.  THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF THE LEAK COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE THE RISER AND A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE.  WHILE THE EXACT IGNITION FACTOR IS NOT KNOWN, ANY APPLIANCE THAT WOULD CYCLE ON OR OFF WOULD LIKELY HAVE PROVIDED SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO IGNITE THE NATURAL GAS/AIR MIXTURE ONCE IT HAD REACHED THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.    WITH RESPECT TO THE BROKEN OR CRACKED GAS SERVICE LINE THAT RESULTED IN THE GAS LEAK, WE KNOW THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE PRECEDING 4 YEARS, THE RESIDENT HAD FILLED A SINK-TYPE OF HOLE IN THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE HOME THAT WAS ABOVE THE GAS LINE AND NEAR THE METER.  THE SETTLING OF THE SOIL IN THAT HOLE COULD HAVE PUT STRESS ON THE GAS LINE.  IN ADDITION, IN THE DAY (OR DAYS) BEFORE THE FIRE, A MEMBER OF THE RESIDENT'S FAMILY HAD ADDED CLASS FIVE ROCK TO THE TOP OF THE SINK HOLE AREA AND THEN PACKED IT DOWN WITH A BOBCAT, WHICH MAY HAVE ADDED TO OR CREATED STRESS ON THE GAS LINE, POSSIBLY ENOUGH TO CRACK OR BREAK IT AT THAT TIME.  XCEL ENERGY DOES NOT HAVE RECORDS OF THIS CUSTOMER CONTACTING US FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THE SINK HOLE NEAR THE GAS LINE, OR MAKING US AWARE OF ANY RELATED PROBLEMS.  OUR RECORDS REVEAL THAT THE METER LOCATION AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL LOCATION OF THE METER.   WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE METER WAS MOVED BY AN UNKNOWN PARTY, NOT XCEL ENERGY, TO MAKE ROOM FOR A GARAGE ADDITION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE HOUSE APPROXIMATELY 2007.

THIS RESIDENCE IS A GARAGE APARTMENT BEHIND 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH, FL. THE SERVICE TECH FROM FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILTIES ARRIVED AT 11:59 AM AND FOUND THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO 410 59TH ST. TURNED OFF AT THE METER BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AS THEY WERE EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE.  THE TECH FOUND THE 3/4"" BARE STEEL NATURAL GAS SERVICE LEAKING UNDER A CONCRETE SLAB AT THE RESIDENCE. FLORIDA PUBLIC UTLITIES DISPATCHED A DISTRIBUTION CREW TO CUT THE SERVICE AT THE MAIN AND CAP IT AT 1:00 PM ON 8/28/12.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AS A RESULT OF TROPICAL STORM ISAAC, THERE WERE MULTIPLE LIGHTENING STRIKES IN THE AREA OF THE RESIDENCE ON FRIDAY, 8/24/12. NEWS REPORTS STATED THAT THE RESIDENT OF 410.5 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH STARTED SMELLING GAS AROUND THIS TIME. HE DID NOT NOTIFY FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILITIES BUT LOOKED FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR HIMSELF ON TUESDAY, 8/28/12.  ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT IS A PICTURE OF A SECTION OF 3/4"" BARE STEEL SERVICE THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED AT 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH. IT APPEARS TO HAVE A HOLE CAUSED BY AN ELECTRICAL ARC.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS DETERMINIED THAT THE 3/4"" BS GAS SERVICE WAS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A CAST IRON SEWER LINE AND A GALVANIZED ELECTRICAL CONDUIT. THE ELECTRICAL CONDUIT WAS INSTALLED AT SOME POINT AFTER THE GAS SERVICE WAS INSTALLED WHEN THE GARAGE WAS CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT AND A CONCRETE SLAB WAS POURED OVER THEM ON THE GROUND.    STRAY CURRENT EITHER FROM AN ELECTIC POWER POLE OR INDUCED UPON THE  CONDUIT AND PIPING CAUSED AN ARC BETWEEN THE CONDUIT AND PIPES RESULTING IN A SMALL HOLE IN THE GAS PIPING. GAS LEAKED UNDER THE SLAB AS A RESULT OF THE ARC HOLE BEGINNING ON 8/24/12 AND VENTED INTO THE GARAGE APARTMENT. WHEN THE RESIDENT OF 410 59TH ST. BEGAN TO LOOK FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR ON 8/28/12, HE LIT A CIGARETTE, IGNITING THE GAS IN THE APARTMENT.      5/28/2015 - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT FILED ON 4/28/2014.   1. THE LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE COORDINATES WERE CORRECTED FROM THE ORIGINAL COORDINATES THAT WERE OBTAINED FROM GOOGLE MAPS AND WERE SLIGHTLY INACCURATE.  2. THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS CHANGED FROM G2 - NATURAL FORCE DAMAGE (LIGHTNING) TO G4 - OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE (ELECTRICAL ARCING). ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LIGHTNING IN THE AREA DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, THE EXACT SOURCE OF THE CURRENT THAT ARCED A HOLE IN THE GAS SERVICE COULD NOT BE DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION.  3. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS REVIEWED AND LEFT AS STATED. THE DAMAGE AND REMOVAL OF DEBRIS WERE CONFINED TO AN UNPERMITTED AND UNINHABITED DETACHED GARAGE THAT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT. THE REPAIR OF THE GAS MAIN CONSISTED OF INSTALLING A STOP FITTING AND INSERTING APPROX. 100' OF STEEL MAIN WITH PE PIPE AND RUNNING APPROX. 33' OF PE SERVICE. THE ASSESSED VALUE FOR THE ENTIRE PROPERTY AT 410 59TH ST, WEST PALM BEACH WAS $75,210 WITH A MARKET VALUE OF $92,639 IN 2012. THE MEDICAL COSTS FOR THE INJURED PARTY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROPERTY DAMAGE AMOUNT.  4. REFERENCE TO ""ACTIVE LITIGATION"" WAS REMOVED FROM LAST NARRATIVE.  5.

ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT R&W WAS RETIRING A SECTION OF 12 INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL GAS MAIN ON BROADWAY AT 1ST STREET IN WEST NYACK.  THE 12 INCH MAIN RUNS NORTH AND SOUTH ON BROADWAY AND HAD A RADIAL 4 INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN COMING OFF TO THE WEST ON 1ST ST.  R&W EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED THE 12 INCH AND 4 INCH MAIN.   THE BALLOON STOPPERS WERE INFLATED TO 4 PSI TESTED FOR LEAKAGE AND HELD PRESSURE FOR OVER ONE HOUR BEFORE BEING USED.  THEY INSTALLED TWO TAPPING TEES AND FOUR LOW PRESSURE BALLOON STOPPERS INTO THE 12 INCH PIPE AT THE LOCATIONS SHOWN ON THE SKETCH.  THE 4 INCH MAIN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEAD ENDED WITH A CAP FURTHER WEST ALONG 1ST STREET AND DID NOT REQUIRE ANY STOPPERS.  R&W THEN PERFORMED A FLOW TEST TO CONFIRM THAT GAS WAS BEING SUPPLIED TO THE MAIN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ISOLATED SECTION.  THE PRESSURE GAUGES ON THE BALLOON STOPPERS WERE CHECKED TO CONFIRM THAT THE STOPPERS WERE HOLDING AND THAT THE SECTION WAS EFFECTIVELY ISOLATED.  R&W CUT THE 12 INCH PIPE ON THE NORTH END OF THE EXCAVATION WITH A REED 4 WHEEL PIPE CUTTER.  THEY THEN MADE TWO CUTS WITH A DEMO SAW ON THE 4 INCH STEEL MAIN, REMOVING A 4 INCH RING.    R&W USED AN ORBITAL CUTTER AND TORCH TO BEVEL CUT THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 12 INCH MAIN.   THE CREW MADE A SECOND CUT AND REMOVED ABOUT A 4 INCH RING AT THE SOUTHERLY END OF THE 12 INCH PIPE.  WHEN THE RINGS WERE CUT R&W HAD SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE AND THE CUT OUT SECTION WAS REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION.  R&W SET UP THE ORBITAL CUTTER TO BEVEL THE ROUGH CUT ON THE NORTH END OF THE 12 INCH MAIN.  THE CONTRACTOR'S WELDER AND CREW FOREMAN WERE IN THE EXCAVATION AND BEGAN TO MAKE THE BEVEL CUT.  AT 16:28, WHEN THEY HAD FLAME CUT APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE, THE NORTHERLY BALLOON STOPPERS FAILED AND THE LEAKING GAS IGNITED.  BOTH MEN EXITED THE EXCAVATION AND WERE NOT INJURED BY THE IGNITION OR THE ENSUING GAS FED FIRE.  THE THREE REGULATOR STATIONS SUPPLYING THE AFFECTED AREA WERE TURNED OFF AND THE RESIDUAL GAS BURNED OFF.  APPROXIMATELY 385 GAS SERVICES WERE INTERRUPTED.  OVERHEAD ELECTRIC FACILITIES IN THE AREA WERE DE-ENERGIZED INTERRUPTING APPROXIMATELY 650 SERVICES.  ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS RESTORED AT APPROXIMATELY 20:40 THAT EVENING.

THE MAINLINE, OWNED AND OPERATED BY AVISTA UTILITIES, WAS OPERATING AT 289 PSIG (300 PSIG - SYSTEM MAOP) AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE EXCAVATOR DIG-IN RESULTED IN BLOWING GAS THAT IGNITED IN EXPLOSION, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN EXCAVATOR BACKFIRE. THE RESULTING FIRE TOTALED THE EXCAVATOR EQUIPMENT INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT AND CAUSED ADDITIONAL DAMAGE TO A RAILROAD CROSS-ARM, AN ADJACENT WAREHOUSE STRUCTURE AND LOCAL ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES (ALSO OWNED AND OPERATED BY AVISTA UTILITIES). IT IS AVISTA'S UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CONTRACTOR WAS OPERATING USING LOCATES FROM A ONE-CALL TICKET THAT HAD EXPIRED 14-DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT AND MARKS WERE NO LONGER FULLY VISIBLE.     AVISTA DISPATCH WAS NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1335-HOURS. AVISTA PERSONNEL WERE EN-ROUTE BY 1338-HOURS AND ON LOCATION BY 1351-HOURS. GAS FLOW WAS ISOLATED AT 1355-HOURS BY CLOSING THREE SYSTEM EOP VALVES (AVISTA VALVE #S LEC 128, LEC 130 & LEC 542) WITHIN CLOSE VICINITY TO THE AREA. AT THIS TIME LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDERS WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE FIRE. POLICE ALSO RESPONDED AND LOCAL MEDIA FOLLOWED THE INCIDENT CLOSELY.  THERE WERE NO DEATHS AND ONLY MINOR INJURIES (NO HOSPITALIZATION REQUIRED) AS A RESULT OF THE EVENT.     AVISTA GAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS WORKED TO REPAIR DAMAGED GAS FACILITIES OVER THE NEXT 9-DAYS FOLLOWING THE DIG-IN. THE SYSTEM WAS REPAIRED, RE-TESTED AND RESTORED TO FULL OPERATION BY 1530-HOURS ON 11/28/2012. ONLY ONE AVISTA NATURAL GAS CUSTOMER LOST SERVICE AS A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS.    THE RESULTING OPERATOR AND NON-OPERATOR DAMAGE COSTS FROM THE EVENT ARE ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $50,000 WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THIS REPORTABLE.

BUTLER,GAS AND WATER OPERATIONS MANAGER,256-535-1240,jimmie.butler@hsvutil.org,"AT APPROXIMATLEY 2218 (10:18PM CST) ON JANUARY 15, 2013, HUNTSVILLE UTILITIES (HU) DISPATCH CENTER RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM HUNTVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT (HPD) REQUESTING EMERGENCY RESPONSE FROM THE HU GAS DEPARTMENT AT 850 WASHINGTON WHERE A STRUCTURE FIRE WAS IN PROGRESS.  HFD DISPATCHER ADVISED THAT THEY RECEIVED A REPORT OF A ""BOOM"" FOLLOWED BY FIRE.  GAS WAS SMELLED IN THE AREA AND OUR CREWS WERE URGENTLY REQUESTED.    OPERATOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM HU GAS DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON SITE AT 2230 (10:30PM CST) ON JANUARY 15, 2013.  HFD AND THE HUNTSVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT (HPD) WERE ON SITE AND HAD EXTINGUISHED A FIRE AT THE PUBLIC HOUSING DWELLING UNIT AT 851 UNIT C WASHINGTON ST AND SECURED THE AREA.  UPON SMELLING NATURAL GAS THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL HELP TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE APPARENT GAS LEAK.    CREWS WERE CALLED IN AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SHUTTING OFF THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO THE ENTIRE PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT AT 0230 (2:30AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT AN UNDERGROUND STEEL DISTRIBUTION VALVE, 2 INCH IN DIAMETER, HAD A CRACKED FLANGE.  THIS LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY REMOVING THE VALVE ALONG WITH ANOTHER SIMILIAR VALVE AND REPLACING IT WITH COATED STEEL PIPE.  THE LEAK WAS TWENTY FEET AWAY FROM THE DWELLING AT 851 WASHINGTON ST.  GAS SERVICE WAS THEN RESTORED TO THE AREA AT 0745 (7:45AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.      AFTER THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED HU GAS DEPARTMENT CREWS BEGAN TO CONDUCT A NUMBER OF TESTS IN THE VICINTY OF 851 WASHINGTON ST.  THESE TESTS INCLUDED A LEAK SURVEY, CATHODIC PROTECTION PIPE TO SOIL READINGS, BAR HOLE TEST AND A PRESSURE TEST OF ALL THREE GAS SERVICE LINES TO 851 WASHINGTON ST., AS THIS BUILDING WAS A TRI-PLEX COMPRISED OF UNITS A, B, AND C.  ALL THREE GAS SERVICES HELD THE TEST PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATLY +125 PSIG WITH NO LEAKS INDICATED.  A TEST OF THE FUEL LINE (CUSTOMER PIPING) AT UNIT C FAILED, INDICATING A LEAK INSIDE THE UNIT.    AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS ON GOING.  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR(S) MAY HAVE BEEN THE LEAK ON THE FUEL LINE, THE UNDERGROUND GAS LEAK OR SOME OTHER FACTOR.    THE LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WERE A TEMPERATURE OF 37 DEGREES FARENHEIT,  THE WIND SPEED WAS 5 MPH, NO WIND GUSTS, WIND DIRECTION WAS 300 (GENERALLY OUT OF THE NORTHWEST).  IT WAS OVERCAST WITH A LIGHT RAINFALL.    A SUPPLEMENTAL OR SUPPLEMENTAL PLUS FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED AS SOON AS NEW, UPDATED AND/OR CORRECTED INFORMATION IS KNOWN.    SEPTEMBER 8, 2016-THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT. EXPERT WITNESSES DETERMINED THAT SOMETHING HEAVY LIKE A VEHICLE RAN OVER A VALVE BOX CAUSING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON A 2 INCH FLANGED ROCKWELL FIGURE 143 VALVE CAUSING THE VALVE TO CRACK IN A FLANGE. GAS THEN MIGRATED ALONG A DITCH LINE INTO THE DWELLING CAUSING AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE."

EXTERNAL CORROSION WAS NOT A FACTOR, SINCE NONE WAS OBSERVED, INDICATING THE WRAPPING AND CATHODIC PROTECTION OF THIS PIPE WERE SATISFACTORY.

USIC LOCATING, INC. PERFORMED ONE-CALL LOCATING FOR THE CITY OF KANSAS CITY, MGE AND OTHER UNDERGROUND FACILITY OWNERS.  USIC MARKED THE PRESENCE OF ONE UNDERGROUND ELECTRICAL LINE FOR THE STREETLIGHTS AND ONE UNDERGROUND GAS LINE ABOUT A FOOT TO THE SOUTH OF THE ELECTRICAL LINE.  HOWEVER, THERE ACTUALLY WERE TWO ELECTRICAL LINES AT THAT LOCATION, NOT ONE, ALONG WITH THE GAS LINE ABOUT A FOOT TO THE SOUTH OF THE TWO ELECTRICAL LINES.  HEARTLAND PERSONNEL DUG ONE POTHOLE BETWEEN THE SINGLE RED BROKEN PAINT LINE FOR ONE ELECTRICAL LINE AND THE SINGLE BROKEN YELLOW PAINT LINE FOR THE GAS LINE MARKED ON THE SURFACE AND FOUND TWO CONDUITS.  HEARTLAND CONCLUDED THEY HAD EXPOSED THE ELECTRICAL LINE AND THE GAS LINE THAT USIC HAD MARKED. IN REALITY, HEARTLAND HAD EXPOSED TWO ELECTRICAL CONDUITS AND HAD NOT EXPOSED THE GAS MAIN.  HEARTLAND THEN DIRECTED THE DRILL TO A DEPTH ABOUT A FOOT BELOW THE CONDUITS AND STRUCK THE GAS MAIN.  HEARTLAND FAILED TO EXTEND THE POTHOLE TO THE DEPTH OF THE PLANNED BORE WHERE THE DRILL COULD BE OBSERVED PASSING BELOW THE CONDUITS. THE GAS LINE WAS STRUCK BETWEEN 16:00 AND 16:30, BUT HEARTLAND PERSONNEL DID NOT NOTIFY EMERGENCY PERSONNEL UNTIL THEY CALLED 911 AT 16:54.  MGE DISPATCH WAS NOTIFIED AT 16:55.      IN REFERENCE TO PART A, QUESTION 16, MGE GAVE EVACUATION ORDERS TO TWO STRUCTURES (906 AND 910 W 48TH STREET) PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.    THE EXPLOSION AT JJ'S RESTAURANT, 910 W. 48TH STREET, KANSAS CITY, MO, OCCURRED AT 18:02. THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE WAS CLOSED AT 19:20. THE TWO-INCH GAS MAIN WAS PINCHED OFF AT THE SE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW AT 20:00. AFTER THE GAS FLOW WAS STOPPED, THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET WAS CUT AND CAPPED AT THE NE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW AND JUST WEST OF THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE. THEN, THE GAS MAIN ON BELLEVIEW WAS RE-ENERGIZED TO ALLOW GAS FLOW TO CUSTOMERS ON BELLEVIEW BETWEEN 48TH AND 47TH STREETS. THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET BETWEEN BELLEVIEW AND ROANOKE IS STILL INACTIVE.    ONE FATALITY AND MULTIPLE INJURIES RESULTED, INCLUDING MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER, AND EMPLOYEES OF HEARTLAND AND JJ'S RESTAURANT. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE, BUT THE TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, IN PART BECAUSE LITIGATION CONTINUES INVOLVING THREE BUILDINGS IN THE VICINITY AND ONE ISSUE IN EACH CASE IS THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE EXPLOSION.    MGE HAD SIX EMPLOYEES ON SITE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION. AS MGE WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE A FULL INVESTIGATION ON THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF ITS ON-SITE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT, FIVE OF THE SIX EMPLOYEES WERE SENT TO THE HOSPITAL LATER THAT EVENING FOR DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING. THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING FOR ALL FIVE EMPLOYEES. DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO FOUR OF THE EMPLOYEES, WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS. A DRUG TEST WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER AN ALCOHOL TEST TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE, BUT DID NOT. THE SIXTH EMPLOYEE, MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER, WAS TESTED FOR ALCOHOL AND DRUGS AFTER THE INCIDENT IN THE COURSE OF THE TREATMENT FOR HIS INJURIES AT ST. LUKE'S HOSPITAL, AND THAT THE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. MGE DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS EMPLOYEES' PERFORMANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT."

VERNON) TO THE GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER. GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) RESPONDED AND OBTAINED A 60% GAS-IN-AIR READING AT THE 20' LINE OF #426 E 4 ST. THE LEAK WAS CLASSIFIED TYPE-1 DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO THE 24"" TRANSMISSION MAIN (230 PSI). GAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND SUPERVISION RESPONDED, INVESTIGATED AND AT 1536 HRS IT WAS DETERMINED THE LEAK MAY BE COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION MAIN. THE 12"" 1957 STEEL TRANSMISSION INLET TO GAS REGULATOR GR-514 WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK IN THE VICINITY OF A DRIP POT AND RISER. GR-514 WAS VALVED OFF AND THE LEAK EXCAVATED AFTER PRESSURE WAS BLED DOWN. THE EXCAVATION DETERMINED THE ACTUAL SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS ON A 1"" COUPLING IN THE DRIP RISER AT THE INLET PIPING TO GR-514. PRESSURE CONTROL, GAS CONTROL AND GAS ENGINEERING DETERMINED THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY NEGATIVE SYSTEM IMPACT DUE TO THE LOSS OF THIS TRANSMISSION PRESSURE TO HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR STATION.   TRANSMISSION VALVES 25960 AND 28563 WERE CLOSED AT 1705 HRS AND PRESSURE REDUCTION THROUGH GR-514. THE LEAKING COUPLING WAS REMOVED AND A WELDED CAP INSTALLED ON THE DRIP POT WHERE THE RISER CONNECTS TO THE DRIP POT, REMOVING THE HAZARD. THE REGULATOR STATION REMAINED OFFLINE WHILE ADDITIONAL PLANNED WORK REPLACING 70' OF THE AFFECTED SECTION OF INLET PIPING TO THE REGULATOR STATION WAS COMPLETED.

AMES EMPLOYEES WERE EXCAVATING WITH A TRACKHOE WHEN THE END OF A 6' MEDIUM PRESSURE STEEL MAIN WAS SNAGGED IN A SCOOP OF THE TRACKHOE'S BUCKET.  AS THE OPERATOR RAISED THE BUCKET AND TWISTED THE TRACKHOE 180 DEGREES, THE 6' MAIN WAS LIFTED, WITH THE SOIL IN THE BUCKET, UP AND AWAY IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION.  A LATERAL 6' MAIN TIED TO THIS MAIN CONTAINED A COMPRESSION INSULATING COUPLING APPROXIMATELY 3' WEST OF THE SNAGGED MAIN.  AS THE PIPE WAS PULLED UP AND AWAY THE LATERAL WAS PULLED FROM THE COMPRESSION COUPLING RESULTING IN A 6' FULLY OPEN ORIFICE BLOWING GAS AND DEBRIS ONTO THE SOUTHBOUND I 215 FREEWAY, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SHUT DOWN BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL.  DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT WITHIN THE PRESSURE DISTRICT, THE CLOSURE OF THE FREEWAY AND SIGNIFICANT LOSS IN PRESSURE WITHIN THE PRESSURE DISTRICT, GAS WAS CONTROLLED BY SHUTTING IN THE REGULATOR STATION TO THE DISTRICT.  THIS SHUT IN RESULTED IN LOSS OF SERVICE TO OVER 4,000 CUSTOMERS.

NONE OF THESE TESTS FOUND ANY GAS MIGRATION.  ALL THE GAS WAS VENTING TO ATMOSPHERE DIRECTLY ABOVE THE POINT OF FAILURE.    THE POINT OF FAILURE ON THE MAIN WAS UNDER A COUNTY DRAIN DITCH, APPROXIMATELY 20' BELOW THE ROAD GRADE AND UNDER 14' OF SOIL.  THE MAIN WAS CAPPED ON EACH SIDE OF THE FAILURE UPON SHUTOFF.    THE FAILURE POINT WAS LATER EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED, REVEALING A FAILED BUTT FUSE JOINT.  INADEQUATE FUSE BEAD ROLLOVER WAS OBSERVED ON ONE SIDE OF THE FUSE, INDICATING POSSIBLE INCOMPLETE FACING PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE HYDRAULIC BUTT FUSE MACHINE.  THE NON-FUSED ZONE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A GENERALLY SMOOTH FLAT SURFACE APPEARANCE, AS WELL AS PARALLEL CUT MARKS WHICH LIKELY INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE HAD NOT BEEN HEATED TO THE MELTING POINT DURING THE JOINT FUSION OPERATION.

PRIOR TO COMMENCING THE DRILLING WORK, THE CONTRACTOR CALLED THE HAWAII ONE CALL CENTER TO REQUEST THAT TONING BE DONE BY HG TO MARK THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE GAS LINE.  PER THE CONTRACTOR'S ONE CALL REQUEST, HG RESPONDED AND MARKED THE LOCATION OF ITS FACILITY.  USING THE TONING MARKS BY HG AND ITS OWN EQUIPMENT, CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM THE LOCATION OF THE GAS MAIN BEFORE DRILLING.  HG WAS ADVISED THAT THE CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO AVOID DAMAGING OUR LINE BY DRILLING MORE THAN 30 INCHES HORIZONTALLY FROM THE PIPE LOCATION TONING MARK AND TEST BORING USING A NON-POWERED AUGER BEFORE USE OF THE POWERED DRILL RIG.    THE GAS MAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET DEEP WHEN THE CONTRACTOR'S POWERED DRILLING RIG HIT IT.  HG DISPATCHED A CREW TO BEGIN EXCAVATING TO INSTALL LINE STOP FITTINGS.  DUE TO THE PIPE'S DEPTH, HG HAD DIFFICULTY LOCATING AND EXPOSING THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE LINE WHERE THE REPAIR WORK WOULD NEED TO BE DONE AND HALTED WORK AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF EXCAVATING.  TWO PERSONNEL REMAINED ON SITE OVERNIGHT TO MONITOR THE LEAK.    ON 9/24/13, A NEW LOCATION WITH IMPROVED ACCESS TO THE GAS MAIN WAS SELECTED.  AT 10:00 AM, THE FEDERAL FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED SEVERAL BUILDINGS IN THE NEARBY NAVAL HOUSING AREA AS A PRECAUTION DUE TO THE DETECTION OF GAS.  HG LEAK INSPECTORS PERFORMED BELOW GRADE STRUCTURE CHECKS AND DETECTED 100% GAS READINGS IN SEVERAL MANHOLES.  AS A RESULT, HG SET UP BLOWERS TO VENTILATE THE MANHOLES TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ITS CREW AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.    BASED ON OUR INVESTIGATION, HG BELIEVES THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE CONTRACTOR'S INABILITY TO ACCURATELY LOCATE THE PIPE PRIOR TO COMMENCING DRILLING."

THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE FAILURE OF HOPE GAS REGULATORS DUE TO ICING CONDITIONS.  THESE REGULATORS ARE LOCATED IN STATION HX-363 AND REDUCE PRESSURE FROM OVER 500 PSIG TO 70 PSIG.    AT 06:47, A SERVICE PIPELINE THAT IS CONNECTED TO M-3095 RUPTURED, CAUSING A BLOWING LEAK.  THE SYSTEM WAS ISOLATED AND COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AT 8:10.  NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OCCURRED.    A CONSULTANT (JANA LABORATORIES, INC.) WAS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE INCIDENT AND RECOMMEND CHANGES.  AS ADVISED BY JANA LABS' PRELIMINARY REPORT, DOMINION HOPE GAS IS IN THE PROCESS OF INSPECTING AND/OR REPLACING VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SYSTEM.  TESTING OF THE PIPELINES AND THE REGULATING/METERING STATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 46 CFR PART 192.

A CODE MURRE (MULTIPLE RESOURCE RESPONSE EVENT) WAS INITIATED AND GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS), NUMEROUS SUPERVISORS, CONSTRUCTION, PHOTOGRAPHER, CHEM LAB, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND ELECTRIC #9 WERE DISPATCHED. AT 08:16 A CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR ARRIVED ON LOCATION, AND CONFIRMED THE COLLAPSE WITH SIGNIFICANT FDNY, NYPD, & EMS RESPONSE. THE FDNY WAS IN THE COLLAPSED BUILDING ATTEMPTING TO SECURE AN OPEN-ENDED GAS PIPE. GERC SUPPLIED THE CURB VALVE LOCATION FOR 1300 BLONDELL AVE, AS 2601 WESTCHESTER AVE HAD NO DIRECT GAS SERVICE. THE GAS SUPPLY PIPE TO A CEILING MOUNTED SPACE HEATER HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY FALLING DEBRIS RESULTING IN GAS FREELY BLOWING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AT 08:22 THE FDNY TEMPORARILY SECURED THE OPEN-ENDED HOUSE PIPE WITH TAPE. AT 08:24 THE CURB VALVE WAS CLOSED SECURING THE LEAK. AT 08:27 GDS VERIFIED A 100% SHUTDOWN FROM THE 1.25"" LOW PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE CURB VALVE. AT 08:46 THE ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS DE-ENERGIZED TO THE BUILDING. CHANNEL 12 NEWS REPORTED THAT A ONE STORY AUTO BODY SHOP COLLAPSED DUE TO AN AIR COMPRESSOR EXPLOSION INSIDE THE BUILDING; ADDITIONAL REPORTS ON-SITE AND IN THE MEDIA STATED A GARAGE COMPRESSOR EXPLODED CAUSING THE BUILDING TO COLLAPSE. NO FIRE CONDITION WAS DETECTED PER FDNY CHIEF SAKOVICH. TWO OCCUPANTS, A FATHER AND SON (BENEDETTO MONDELLO - DOB-7/16/1950, BENJAMIN MONDELLO - DOB- 3/8/1978) WERE TAKEN BY EMS TO JACOBI HOSPITAL DUE TO INJURIES SUSTAINED IN THE EXPLOSION. FDNY CHIEF SEELIG INITIALLY REPORTED THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION.   INITIAL LEAK INVESTIGATIONS DETECTED NO GAS ODOR OR READINGS IN THE BUILDINGS ACCESSED AS WELL AS IN SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES. A POGO SURVEY OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA BY GDS DETECTED NO OUTSIDE READINGS. LEAK SURVEY RESPONDED AND PERFORMED SEVERAL LEAK SURVEYS OF THE AREA SURROUNDING THE INCIDENT. THE INITIAL SURVEY AT 09:10 DETECTED NO READINGS BUT A SECOND SURVEY AT 09:50 DETECTED 4.4% AT THE OUTSIDE FOUNDATION WALL OF 1314 COOPER AVE. THE FDNY PROVIDED ACCESS AND 2% WAS DETECTED IN THE ELECTRIC POINT OF ENTRY AT THE INSIDE FOUNDATION WALL. 1320 COOPER AVE WAS CHECKED AND FOUND CLEAR, AND SB 24280 SUPPLYING #1314 WAS CHECKED AND 60% READING WAS RECEIVED. THE COVER WAS PULLED TO VENT THE STRUCTURE. SB 22786 WAS CHECKED AND 58% WAS DETECTED AND THE COVER PULLED TO VENT THE STRUCTURE; ADJACENT MANHOLES M10930 AND M23142 WERE FOUND CLEAR. A BAR HOLE SURVEY DETECTED 40%-90% GAS READINGS OVER THE 6"" LPCI 1952 MAIN ON COOPER AVE. THE 6"" MAIN WAS EXCAVATED AND CUT ON THE 6"" SIDE OF THE 12"" X 12"" X 6"" 3-WAY TEE ON WESTCHESTER AND COOPER AVES. AN INTEGRITY TEST OF THE HOUSE PIPING FROM THE 1/2"" OPEN-ENDED PIPE BACK TO THE HOS VALVE WAS PERFORMED AT 6"" W.C AND PASSED AFTER A 10 MINUTE TEST WHICH WAS WITNESSED BY THE PSC. LEAK SURVEILLANCE OF THE AREA DETECTED NO GAS READINGS AFTER THE MAIN WAS CUT AND CAPPED. ON MONDAY, DEC. 2 A CAMERA INSPECTION WITNESSED BY THE PSC OF THE ISOLATED SECTION OF MAIN IDENTIFIED A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK WHICH WAS EXCAVATED, CONFIRMED AND REMOVED FOR ANALYSIS. CHEMICAL SAMPLING OF THE SOIL WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSE IDENTIFIED CHEMICALS INCLUDING ACETONE AND FUELS AT LEVELS THAT MET OR EXCEEDED NYC DEP AND/OR NYS DEC REPORTING THRESHOLDS AND NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THOSE AGENCIES. CHANNEL 2, 4 AND 12 NEWS MEDIA WERE ON LOCATION. CIG, PSC, DOT AND DEP WERE NOTIFIED.

IN SHREWSBURY WHILE PERFORMING A MAIN CUT OUT. THE CREW WAS CUTTING OUT A SECTION OF 4 INCH IP PLASTIC MAIN THAT WAS LEAKING. THE CREW HAD INSTALLED A 2 INCH PLASTIC BYPASS AROUND THE LEAK AND HAD SQUEEZED OFF THE 4 INCH MAIN TO STOP OFF THE GAS. WHILE PREPARING FOR THE MAIN CUT OUT OF 4 INCH PLASTIC, A SUDDEN RUSH OF GAS OCCURRED AND THEN THE GAS IGNITED CAUSING A FIRE TO OCCUR IN THE EXCAVATION. THERE WERE 2 EMPLOYEES IN THE EXCAVATION WHO WERE ABLE TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THE HOLE JUST BEFORE THE IGNITION OCCURRED. ONE OF THESE EMPLOYEES DID RECEIVE SOME BURNS AND WAS TREATED AND RELEASED FROM A HOSPITAL. THE RESULTING FIRE ALSO SPREAD TO AN NSTAR BACKHOE PARKED AT THE EXCAVATION. THE SHREWSBURY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO CONTROL THE GAS FIRE. AT 1:50 PM A MAIN VALVE ON COLONIAL DR. WAS SHUT TO STOP THE LEAKING GAS AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. THIS RESULTED IN AN OUTAGE TO 135 CUSTOMERS. NSTAR HAD TO REPLACE ABOUT 20 FEET OF 4 INCH PLASTIC MAIN DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE. AFTER THE SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED FOR ALL CUSTOMERS, THE GAS MAINS WERE PURGED AND THE GAS WAS TURNED BACK ON AT 8:15 PM. THE FIRST CUSTOMER WAS RE-LIT AT 8:30 PM AND A FIRST PASS TO RE-LITE ALL 135 CUSTOMERS WAS COMPLETED AT 11:45 PM. NSTAR IS IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING WAS CAUSED THE SUDDEN LEAKAGE OF GAS AND ALSO WHAT CAUSED THE IGNITION TO OCCUR.    SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE - UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS FOUND THAT A COMPLETE SQUEEZE WAS NOT ACHIEVED WITH A MUSTANG SQUEEZE TOOL USED ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE REPAIR. THIS RESULTED IN LIVE GAS IN WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE AN ISOLATED SECTION OF MAIN. THIS WAS NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE CREW, WHO THEN BEGAN TO REMOVE A STEEL FULL ENCIRCLEMENT CLAMP THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED 3 DAYS PRIOR AS A TEMPORARY REPAIR, WHICH LED TO A RELEASE OF GAS.

THE CALLER STATED THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED AND THAT THERE WAS ALSO GAS BURNING. WE ENERGIES IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED A FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SITE.  THE FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 11:47 A.M. AND OBSERVED A STRUCTURE FIRE; BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF AN EXPLOSION. THE EMPLOYEE NOTED THAT THE STRUCTURE FIRE WAS ESSENTIALLY UNDER CONTROL BUT NATURAL GAS WAS BURNING AT THE OUTSIDE METER AND AT A FEW LOCATIONS ON THE GROUND NEAR THE BUILDING. THE FIRST RESPONDER SAW THAT MORE RESOURCES WERE NEEDED TO REMOTELY SHUT OFF THE GAS AND MADE THE REQUEST TO THE DISPATCHER. THE FIRST RESPONDER AND ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WHO HAD ARRIVED PROCEEDED TO CHECK FOR GAS MIGRATION AND WORK WITH FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO KEEP A SAFE PERIMETER. INITIAL PROBING AND RECHECKS VERIFIED THAT GAS WAS ONLY IN THE AREA OF THE STRUCTURE FIRE.  AT ABOUT 12:52 P.M., MORE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND BEGAN DIGGING TO REMOTELY SQUEEZE OFF GAS ON THIS ONE-WAY FEED TO 2800 LAKESHORE WAY AND THE PROPERTY TO THE NORTH. A FROST DEPTH OF ABOUT 3 FT. MADE EXCAVATION HARD, AND THE 1958-INSTALLED 1 1/4 IN. STEEL GAS MAIN TO THE PROPERTIES WAS SQUEEZED OFF AT ABOUT 3:09 P.M. ALL FIRE AT THE PROPERTY WAS EXTINGUISHED SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  TO CONFIRM THE UNOCCUPIED HOME TO THE NORTH WAS SAFE, ACCESS WAS GAINED WITH POLICE ASSISTANCE AT ABOUT 1:30 P.M. AND ALL THREE LEVELS CHECKED AT 0%.  DUE TO THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE POTENTIALLY CAUSED BY GAS LEAKAGE FROM OPERATOR FACILITIES, A PHONE NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT ABOUT 4:00 P.M. TO REPORT THIS EVENT AS A POSSIBLE INCIDENT PER 49 CFR PART 191.3. THE WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (WPSC) WAS ALSO NOTIFIED.  A LINE STOPPER WAS INSTALLED AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY BY ABOUT 6:30 P.M. ON 1/30/14. AFTER VERIFYING THAT THE SITE WAS SAFE, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO WAIT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY TO CONDUCT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.  ON 1/31/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE FOR INVESTIGATIONS. INITIAL PRESSURE TESTING OF THE ABANDONED MAIN AND SERVICE INDICATED AN UNDERGROUND LEAK, AND IT WAS BELIEVED NECESSARY TO EXCAVATE AT THE SERVICE TEE. SINCE THE PROPERTY OWNERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH MOVING NECESSARY PERSONAL PROPERTY, FURTHER EXCAVATION WAS DELAYED UNTIL FEBRUARY 4TH.  ON 2/4/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. UPON EXCAVATION AT THE SERVICE TEE LOCATION FOR 2800 LAKESHORE WAY, A BENT SECTION OF MAIN WAS IDENTIFIED. THE MAIN WAS BENT IN AN ARC, AND WAS DISPLACED VERTICALLY BY ABOUT 3 IN. OVER A 6 FT. LENGTH. THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE WAS FLATTENED AND A CRACK WAS FOUND IN THE BENT SECTION OF THE PIPE. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING A PRIOR EXCAVATION AND THAT MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE DEEP FROST LEVELS OBSERVED THIS WINTER CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE. ONE-CALL CENTER RECORDS DO NOT INDICATE ANY RECENT LOCATE TICKET REQUESTS AND IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE EXCAVATION ACTIVITY THAT DAMAGED THE PIPE OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO.  A NEW PE MAIN WAS INSTALLED ON LAKESHORE WAY AND GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED PROPERTY WAS RESTORED ON 2/14/14.  A FORMAL INCIDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 2/21/14. PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVIEW INCLUDED GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKERS AT THE SCENE AFTER THE FIRE WAS REPORTED AND OTHER COMPANY PERSONNEL WHO ASSISTED AT THE SCENE. PIPELINE SAFETY ENGINEERS FROM THE WPSC, ONE OF WHOM HAD INSPECTED THE SITE THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE, ALSO ATTENDED. THE REVIEW RECOUNTED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH PARTICIPANT AND INCLUDED COMMUNICATIONS CONDUCTED AMONG INVOLVED PERSONNEL.  WE ENERGIES IS PERFORMING MORE LEAK SURVEYS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED IN CFR 49, PART 192 ON SIMILAR TYPE FACILITIES BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME WINTER CONDITIONS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITOR"

BANCROFT STREET.  AN FSD TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THIS LEAK.  HE ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 17:29 AND BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION.  A READING OF 70% LEL AT THE FRONT FOUNDATION WALL TO 1845 S. BANCROFT WAS REPORTED BY THE TECHNICIAN TO THE FSD DISPATCHER.  BASED ON THIS REPORT, A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS DISPATCHED AT 18:10.  FSD AND DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISION WERE ALSO DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION.  THE CREW ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 18:24 AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR INVESTIGATION.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WHILE THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND THE FSD TECHNICIAN WERE INSIDE THE PROPERTY AT 1849 S. BANCROFT CHECKING FOR GAS READINGS, AN EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 19:05 INSIDE 1849 S. BANCROFT.  THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE TWO RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT 1849 AND 1847 S. BANCROFT.  IT ALSO INJURED BOTH PGW EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE, AS WELL AS ONE HOMEOWNER.  THE INJURIES SUSTAINED BY ALL THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE NON-LIFE THREATENING.  BOTH THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND HOMEOWNER WERE TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT AND RELEASED ON THE SAME DAY WHILE THE FSD TECHNICIAN WAS ADMITTED WITH BURNS TO HIS NECK AND LOWER TORSO.  THE EXPLOSION AT THE SCENE WAS OBSERVED BY A FSD SUPERVISOR WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 19:05.  PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT, PHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND PECO ENERGY WERE CALLED IN FOR ASSISTANCE, IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS PGW RESOURCES SUCH AS, DISTRIBUTION CREWS, FSD TECHNICIANS, MOBILE EQUIPMENT, GREASE TRUCK, SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL, CHEMICAL SERVICES, ETC.  THE PAPUC WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.    THE GAS MAIN IN THE EAST FOOTWAY IN FRONT OF 1849 S. BANCROFT (4"" 1939 LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN) WAS GREASED OFF THROUGH A PLASTIC SERVICE TO 1843 S. BANCROFT AT 19:51 AND THE LEAK CONSEQUENTLY WAS MADE SAFE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GREASING OFF, A TOTAL OF FOUR (4) PROPERTIES WERE TEMPORARILY OUT OF GAS.  PECO ALSO SHUT OFF THE ELECTRIC POWER TO 1849 S. BANCROFT AT 21:00.  AFTER MAKING THE JOB SAFE AND RECEIVING THE GO AHEAD FROM PFD, PGW PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE CONTINUED WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  EVERY BUILDING ON THE 1800 BLOCK OF S. BANCROFT WAS CHECKED FOR GAS READINGS.  ALSO, THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN ON THE BLOCK ALONG WITH ALL ACTIVE GAS SERVICES WERE BAR HOLED IN ORDER TO CHECK FOR ANY POSSIBLE LEAKS.  DURING THIS BLOCK CHECK THE CREW PICKED UP LEL READINGS IN FRONT OF 1835 AND 1816/1818.  A BROKEN MAIN WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND AND REPAIRED IN FRONT OF 1818 AND A TOTAL OF SIX (6) SERVICES ON THE BLOCK WERE RENEWED WITH PLASTIC.  THE GREASED 4"" MAIN WAS ALSO CUT AND CAPPED AT 03:45.  THIS PORTION OF THE 4"" MAIN THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED (100') WAS AIR TESTED AT 6"" WC AND THE TEST FAILED.  THIS SECTION OF THE MAIN WAS THEN EXCAVATED COMPLETELY AND A BROKEN MAIN WAS FOUND IN FRONT OF 1849.  AN 8' SECTION OF THE PIPE, CONTAINING THE BROKEN MAIN, WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION, TAGGED AS EVIDENCE AND TRANSPORTED TO THE PGW EVIDENCE ROOM ON 1/31/2014.  IT IS BELIEVED FROST HEAVE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE BROKEN MAIN, FOURTEEN INCHES OF FROST WAS MEASURED AT THIS LOCATION. THE SERVICES TO 1845 AND 1847 (BOTH 1 1/4"" UNPROTECTED STEEL SERVICES) WERE ALSO AIR TESTED AND FAILED.  AFTER THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED, THE GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE SHUT OFF DURING THE GREASE OFF PROCESS.  THE BUILDING AT 1849 WAS DEMOLISHED ON 2/1/2014. PGW SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN.    ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT PIPE SHOWED THAT IT NEVER COMPLETELY FRACTURED CIRCUMFERENTIALLY AND THE CRACK WAS CONSIDERED TIGHT WITH NO LARGE GAP BETWEEN THE MATING SURFACES. THE CAST IRON MAIN EXHIBITED GRAPHITIZATION BUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPE WOULD HAVE PERSISTED IF LEFT UNDISTURBED AND NOT UNDER LOADING CONDITIONS. THE LOADING CONDITIONS ARE BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY THE EFFECTS OF 14 INCHES OF FROST."

A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION BY SWG.    NOTE: FOR PART A, #10, THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF GAS RELEASED THAT IS IDENTIFIED REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE THAT PRESUMES A CRACK THAT IS LEAKING AT 57 PSI, BEGINNING AT THE TIME OF THE INTIAL REPORT OF THE INCIDENT AND ENDING AT THE TIME THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN.  HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF GAS LOSS IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE THE TIME THE GAS PIPELINE BEGAN LEAKING IS UNKNOWN.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:  LABORATORY ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE LEAKS WERE PRESENT DUE TO THERMAL OXIDATION OF THE PIPES AT 1914 AND 1924 E. PALOMINO.  THE THERMAL OXIDATION OF THE PIPES RESULTED IN AXIAL SLIT-CRACKS ON THE PIPES AT BOTH LOCATIONS.  SECTION G5 IS REVISED TO REFLECT THIS FACT."

ADDITIONAL BAR TESTING REVEALED SUSTAINED 95% GAS READS AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND 100% GAS READS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET WEST OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE ROAD.  A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS EVIDENT IN THIS LOCATION.  FIRST RESPONDERS THEN TOOK GAS READINGS INSIDE THE BASEMENT AFTER BEING ESCORTED IN BY THE FIRE MARSHALL.    BAR TESTING AT ADJACENT HOUSES (SOUTH AND WEST OF 2754 WILDER) PRODUCED NO GAS READS.    AT 1:42 AM ON MARCH 1, A GAS DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED AND EXPOSED THE 2 INCH STEEL MAIN IN FRONT OF (WEST OF) 2754 WILDER.  THE MAIN WAS BENT, CRACKED AND LEAKING.  THE CREW OPENED UP THE HOLE TO VENT THE BLOWING GAS.  A FROST BALL ON THE LEAK WAS KNOCKED OFF AT 5:45 AM, AT WHICH POINT THE GAS BEGAN BLOWING.  AT 9:20 AM, A 2"" PLIDCO REPAIR SLEEVE, WHICH STOPPED THE LEAK AND REPAIRED THE MAIN. INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS DAMAGE DURING INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN; THE EXACT TIME PERIOD OF THE WATER MAIN INSTALLATION IS UNKNOWN. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED ON THE OBSERVED DAMAGE AND PROXIMITY OF THE WATER MAIN. THE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE. A SEARCH OF MISS DIG STAKING REQUESTS FOR THIS LOCATION DID NOT YIELD ANY RECENT STAKING TICKETS WITHIN THE LAST 15 MONTHS.    THE ORIGIN OF THE HOUSEFIRE WAS APPARENTLY THE BASEMENT OF THE HOME.  ALTHOUGH AN ON-SCENE INVESTIGATOR REPRESENTING THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE COMPANY (STATE FARM) INDICATED THAT THE GAS LEAK MAY HAVE CAUSED THE FIRE, FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION BY CONSUMERS ENERGY INDICATES THAT THIS SCENARIO IS UNLIKELY.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF AN EXPLOSION OR INDEED IGNITION OF GAS IN THE HOME, AND WHILE THERE WERE EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF GAS DETECTED IN THE BASEMENT BY FIRST RESPONDERS (0.16% GAS READS, OR 4% LEL), THIS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS (INCLUDING THOSE IN THE BASEMENT) BEING OPENED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, ALLOWING GAS TO ENTER THE HOME FROM OUTSIDE.  THERE WERE NO APPARENT CRACKS OR HOLES IN THE BASEMENT WALL WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE PROVIDE A PATH OF MIGRATION INTO THE HOME, AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND ON THE METER OR THE STEEL GAS SERVICE TO THE HOME.  FURTHERMORE, THE MAJORITY OF FIRE DAMAGE WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE BASEMENT (THE SIDE CLOSEST TO THE GAS FACILITIES)    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF ON SITE WAS ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO COME TO A DETERMINATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSEFIRE.  DUE TO THE LACK OF CERTAINTY ABOUT THE SOURCE OF FIRE, AS WELL AS PROPERTY DAMAGE WITHIN THE HOME (DAMAGES TO APPLIANCES AND SMOKE DAMAGE) LIKELY EXCEEDING $50,000, THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. DAMAGE ESTIMATES FROM THE FIRE OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS INVESTIGATORS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $50,000 TO $110,000; INSURANCE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES STATED THAT THE HOME WAS INSURED TO A VALUE OF $160,000.     INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WERE INCONCLUSIVE AND REPORTED AS SUCH ON THE 30-DAY PHMSA REPORT ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED ON MARCH 27, 2014.  SUBSEQUENT SPECULATION BY AN INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTIGATOR (WITHOUT PERFORMING ANY INVESTIGATION) WAS THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS NATURAL GAS MIGRATION FROM AN EXTERNAL NATURAL GAS LEAK (CAUSED BY THE INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN).  THE SPECULATION OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTIGATOR WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE WATERFORD REGIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT'S REPORT.  DUE TO THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THE SCENE BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, NO ACTUAL INVESTIGATION WAS POSSIBLE AND NO LEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE REACHED."

EIGHT FATALITIES AND APPROXIMATELY 48 REPORTED INJURIES RESULTED FROM THE EXPLOSION AND COLLAPSE.    CON EDISON'S RESPONSE AND ACTION:    AT 09:13 ON MARCH 12, 2014, CON EDISON'S GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER (GERC) RECEIVED A TELEPHONE REPORT FROM CON EDISON'S CALL CENTER OF AN INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GAS ODOR AT 1652 PARK AVENUE.  AT 09:15, GERC DISPATCHED A GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) MECHANIC TO INVESTIGATE THE ODOR REPORT.  AT 09:34, GERC CONFIRMED WITH NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT (FDNY) A SCANNER REPORT OF AN EXPLOSION AND BUILDING COLLAPSE AT E. 114TH ST. AND PARK AVENUE (THE E. 114TH ST. LOCATION WAS INCORRECT).  AT 09:38, THE GDS MECHANIC ENROUTE TO 1652 PARK AVENUE REPORTED OBSERVING SMOKE, FLAMES, AND HEAVY ACTIVITY ON PARK AVENUE SOUTH OF E. 119TH STREET.  GERC DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL CON EDISON PERSONNEL TO THE LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 09:38.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL FIRST ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION AT 09:40 AND CONFIRMED THE EXPLOSION AND COLLAPSE OF TWO BUILDINGS ON PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E. 116TH ST. AND E. 117TH ST.    NUMEROUS CON EDISON PERSONNEL, INCLUDING GDS MECHANICS, CONSTRUCTION CREWS, SUPERVISORS, PLANNERS, AND MANAGERS RESPONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSE.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION FOR GAS MIGRATION THAT INCLUDED ADJACENT BUILDINGS AND ACCESSIBLE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES IN THE AREA.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THREE (3) FIRE BANK LOCATIONS FOR EXCAVATION TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E 116TH ST AND E 117TH ST.  AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, A STREET COLLAPSE AND AN APPARENT WATER MAIN BREAK WERE OBSERVED IN THE ROADWAY IN FRONT OF 1644 AND 1646 PARK AVENUE.  AT THE TIME OF THE STREET COLLAPSE, THERE WAS A STRONG ODOR OF GAS IN THE AREA.    FIRE BANK EXCAVATIONS WERE COMPLETED AND STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED TO ISOLATE THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, AND THE ODOR OF GAS DISSIPATED.  THE 8"" LOW PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE / 8"" LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN SUPPLYING (7) SERVICES ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE AND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF E. 116TH ST., BETWEEN PARK AVENUE AND MADISON AVENUE, WERE ISOLATED.    INVESTIGATION:    FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) TOOK CONTROL OF THE INCIDENT SITE AND BEGAN ITS INVESTIGATION. THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, AND GEORG FISCHER CENTRAL PLASTIC WERE PARTIES TO THE INVESTIGATION. DURING THE COURSE OF THE NTSB INVESTIGATION, CON EDISON PROVIDED A PARTY SUBMISSION DESCRIBING THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AS A BREACH IN THE SEWER SYSTEM WHICH CAUSED SOIL EROSION AFFECTING SUBSURFACE UTILITIES, INCLUDING A CAST IRON WATER MAIN AND HDPE GAS FACILITIES, AND LIKELY RESULTED IN AN IMPACT BY FALLING ROADWAY PAVEMENT WHICH CRACKED THE SERVICE TEE TO 1642 PARK AVENUE. IN ITS ACCIDENT REPORT ADOPTED ON JUNE 9, 2015, THE NTSB DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS (1) THE FAILURE OF THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT AT THE SERVICE TEE, INSTALLED BY CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, INC., IN 2011, THAT ALLOWED NATURAL GAS TO LEAK FROM THE GAS MAIN AND MIGRATE INTO THE BUILDING WHERE IT IGNITED AND (2) A BREACH IN THE SEWER LINE THAT WENT UNREPAIRED BY THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SINCE AT LEAST 2006 THAT ALLOWED GROUNDWATER AND SOIL TO FLOW INTO THE SEWER, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF SUPPORT FOR THE GAS MAIN, WHICH CAUSED THE LINE TO SAG AND OVERSTRESSED THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT."

AT 20:26, DTE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND CONFIRMED THE EXPLOSION AND REPORTED THE GAS METER WAS ON FIRE.   AT 21:50, DTE GAS SERVICE LINE WAS TESTED FOR LEAKS BETWEEN THE MAIN NEAR THE STREET TO THE METER ASSEMBLY AT THE OUTSIDE BUILDING WALL USING AIR AT A PRESSURE OF 2 PSIG FOR DURATION OF 10 MINUTES.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS FOUND TO BE AIR-TIGHT AS A RESULT OF THIS TEST, DEMONSTRATING THE SERVICE LINE WAS NOT LEAKING PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.  DTE GAS PERFORMED UNDERGROUND LEAK CHECKS OVER THE SERVICE LINES AND THE DISTRIBUTION MAIN IN THE AREA AROUND 19717 FAIRPORT; THERE WERE TRACE INDICATIONS OVER THE MAIN OF 0.5% GAS IN AIR, WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.  THERE WERE NO READINGS ALONG THE SERVICE LINE BETWEEN THE MAIN AND THE RESIDENCE.  AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LOCKED SERVICE VALVE AT THE OUTSIDE METER MANIFOLD WAS BROKEN AND TURNED ON BY AN UNAUTHORIZED PERSON(S).  DTE GAS RECORDS INDICATED ON FEBRUARY 18, 2014, THE ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICE WERE TURNED OFF AT THE REQUEST OF PROPERTY OWNER OF RECORD.  ON MARCH 26, 2014, ONLY THE ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS RESTORED AS REQUESTED BY THE PROPERTY OWNER.     THERE WERE NO FATALITIES; HOWEVER FOUR ADULTS AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION.  THE PROPERTY OWNER STATED THERE WAS NO LANDLORD/TENANT AGREEMENT AT THIS LOCATION.  THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME AND THE TRACE INDICATIONS WOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXPLOSION."

THE EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO 4777 WELLINGTON DRIVE TO COMPLETE A LEAK INVESTIGATION ORDER THAT WAS CREATED AT 2152 HOURS. DURING THE LEAK INVESTIGATION, THE EMPLOYEE SMELLED AN ODOR AT THE CORNER OF WELLINGTON DRIVE AND TRENTON COURT AND DETECTED 0.3% LEL WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR (CGI).    THE EMPLOYEE NOTICED FERTILIZER AND MULCH IN THE AREA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES AND TRAINING, THE EMPLOYEE ATTACHED A CHARCOAL FILTER TO THE CGI AND DETECTED 0.0% LEL WITH THE FILTER INSTALLED. THE EMPLOYEE WALKED TOWARDS 4773 TRENTON COURT WHEN THE RESIDENT OF THE AREA FLAGGED THE EMPLOYEE DOWN AND SHOUTED THAT THERE IS A FIRE IN THE RESIDENCE NEXT DOOR. THE EMPLOYEE STARTED TO DIAL 911 AND 4771 TRENTON COURT EXPLODED AT APPROXIMATELY 2243 HOURS.    NORTH SHORE GAS STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS BY CLOSING A SINGLE VALVE AT 0032 HOURS ON 4/26/14 AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LONG GROVE FIRE DEPARTMENT. TWO PEOPLE RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION ONSITE AND WERE RELEASED. OTHER HOMES IN THE AREA WERE DAMAGED DUE TO THE EXPLOSION AND THE EXTENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.    THE GAS MAIN THAT FED 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 2"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1991. THE GAS SERVICE FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 1.125"" BLACK PLASTIC SERVICE THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1996. THE SERVICE DID NOT HAVE AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE AS IT WAS NOT REQUIRED BY CODE AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION. FOLLOWING THE EVENT, THE GAS MAIN AND ALL ASSOCIATED GAS SERVICE PIPES WERE PRESSURE TESTED ON 5/12/14.  THE MAINS AND SERVICES WERE PRESSURE TESTED AT 44 PSIG, THE PRESSURE IN THE LINES AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION FOR 1 HOUR.  ALL MAINS AND SERVICES HELD PRESSURE DEMONSTRATING NO LEAKAGE OUT OF THESE LINES. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION (ICC) PIPELINE SAFETY BRANCH WITNESSED THIS TESTING. THE 4"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN IN WELLINGTON DRIVE WAS RESTARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS ON 4/27/14.    THE RISER FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE ON 5/15/14 FOR AN X-RAY AND IS SCHEDULED TO BE PERFORMED ON 5/23/14. THE METER AND REGULATOR ARE NOT IN A CONDITION THAT CAN BE TESTED.    6/4/14: AN X-RAY TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE RISER PIPE ON 5/23/14 TO TEST THE MECHANICAL ASSEMBLY.     12/31/14: THE BORESCOPE PERFORMED ON 10/10/14 WAS INCONCLUSIVE. ON 11/3/14 THE RISER ASSEMBLY WAS PRESSURE TESTED AND DID NOT HOLD PRESSURE DUE TO EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE PLASTIC PIPE INSIDE THE RISER. THE HOME APPLIANCES ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING TESTED.    9/14/15: A RE-ASSEMBLY OF THE GAS SYSTEM INSIDE OF THE HOUSE IS BEING GENERATED. PGL IS PLANNING AN ADDITIONAL TEST ON THE RISER.    12/15/15: THE RE-ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF THE GAS SYSTEM INSIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS COMPLETED.    6/27/17: FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE RISER DETERMINED A STIFFENER HAD NOT BEEN INSTALLED IN THE SERVICE, AS WAS THE PRACTICE AT THE TIME THE SERVICE WAS INSTALLED. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE RISER WAS LEAKING OR THAT THERE WAS A PATH FOR THE GAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE INTO THE HOUSE IF GAS HAD BEEN PRESENT. THEREFORE, NSG HAS DETERMINED THAT JURISDICTIONAL GAS PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. THE EVENT WAS CAUSED BY CUSTOMER OWNED PIPING AND/OR EQUIPMENT INSIDE THE HOUSE.

A WELDER WAS REQUESTED AND DISPATCHED TO THE WORK SITE TO REPAIR THE LEAKING FITTING.    BLIND FLANGES WERE INSTALLED WHERE THE NEW WORKER/MONITOR SET HAD BEEN REMOVED AND TWO EMPLOYEES BEGAN MAKING A REPAIR TO THE LEAKING FITTING.  A WELD CONE WAS INSTALLED INTO THE LEAKING THREADED FITTING TO STOP THE LEAK PRIOR TO FINALIZING THE REPAIR.  DURING THE CONTAINMENT OF THE LEAKAGE, AS ADDITIONAL WORK WAS BEING CONDUCTED, A SMALL FLASH FIRE OCCURRED, CAUSING SUPERFICIAL BURNS TO ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES COMPLETING THE WORK IN THE VAULT.

CONSTRUCTION, A CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR CENTERPOINT ENERGY, WAS IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING AN EXISTING 3/4"" STEEL SERVICE LINE TO AN INACTIVE ACCOUNT AT 37 KNIGHT DRIVE, NORTH LITTLE ROCK, AR.  A LOCATE WAS REQUESTED FROM THE ARKANSAS ONE CALL CENTER TO LOCATED ALL FACILITIES; HOWEVER THE CONTRACTOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCATING THE CENTERPOINT ENERGY FACILITIES.  EMPLOYEES OF J.F CONSTRUCTION USED A PIPE LOCATOR TO VERIFY THE LOCATION OF THE EXISTING SERVICE, FOUND IT TO NOT BE IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR PLANNED WORK, BUT DID NOT COMPLETELY MARK THE REMAINDER OF THE SERVICE LINE.  DUE TO THE LARGE TREES ON THE PROPERTY, THE ORIGINAL SERVICE LINE INSTALLATION DID NOT TAKE A PERPENDICULAR PATH FROM THE MAIN.  A PNEUMATIC BORING TOOL WAS PLACED IN A BELL HOLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSTALLING A NEW SERVICE.  AFTER BORING FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, THE TOOL STRUCK WHAT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE EXISTING SERVICE LINE. THE IMPACT FROM THE BORING TOOL BENT THE 3/4' STEEL SERVICE LINE AT THE IMPACT POINT, CAUSING A PARTIAL SEPARATION OF THE PIPE AT A THREADED COUPLING SIX FEET EAST OF THE MOBILE HOME AND ANOTHER LEAK OF UNDETERMINED NATURE UNDER THE MOBILE HOME. APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AFTER THE LEAK BEGAN, A SMALL EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AND THE RESULTING FLASH CAUSED SECOND-DEGREE BURNS TO THE RESIDENT INSIDE THE MOBILE HOME.  HYDRAULIC SQUEEZE TOOLS WERE USED TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS AND TO RETIRE/ABANDON THE SERVICE LINE. THE PIPELINE FACILITY (SERVICE LINE) REMAINS SHUT DOWN. HOWEVER, INSTALLATION OF A NEW SERVICE IS NOT ANTICIPATED. THEREFORE, WE ARE NOT PLANNING TO FILE A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.   CENTERPOINT ENERGY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS FROM THIS INCIDENT. WE ANTICIPATE ALL ASSOCIATED COSTS TO BE BORNE BY THE CONTRACTOR.    ALSO, SINCE WE HAVE NO ACCESS TO PROPERTY DAMAGE OR MEDICAL CLAIM INFORMATION, WE ARE ESTIMATING THESE TO BE $50,000."

AT APPROXIMATELY 9:26 P.M. ON 10/1/2014, DOMINION EAST OHIO RECEIVED AN ODOR COMPLAINT AT 7373 SHERMAN CHURCH RD.  A TECHNICIAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA.  AT 9:48 P.M. THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED ON SITE, CONDUCTED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE AREA AND CONCLUDED THAT GAS WAS NOT MIGRATING AND ACCORDING TO AVAILABLE DATA DID NOT BELIEVE THE LEAK TO BE ON A DOMINION FACILITY.  THE TECHNICIAN NOTIFIED THE FIRE CHIEF OF HIS FINDINGS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:55 P.M. DOMINION WAS NOTIFIED BY THE EPA THAT OIL WAS BUBBLING UP FROM THE GROUND AND THAT THEY WERE PICKING UP HIGH NATURAL GAS READINGS.  ANOTHER TECHNICIAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE, ARRIVED AT 12:47 A.M. ON 10/2/2014, AND UPON INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT DEO'S 30"" DISTRIBUTION LINE WAS LEAKING AND CALLED IN FOR A CONSTRUCTION CREW.  THE TECHNICIAN CONTINUED TO LEAK SURVEY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.  AS ADDITIONAL DOMINION PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE, THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED AND DETERMINED THAT THE LINE WAS DEEPER THAN A DOMINION CREW COULD HANDLE, THEREFORE A CONTRACTING CREW WAS MOBILIZED.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 A.M. DOMINION'S ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRACTORS ARRIVED ON SITE AND BEGAN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP ACTIVITIES.  THE AREA WAS EVACUATED AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 A.M.  AS MEASURE OF SAFETY, BEFORE EXCAVATING COULD OCCUR DOMINION DECIDED TO LOWER THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM THE PRESSURE WAS LOWERED FROM 155 PSIG TO 60 PSIG.  ONCE THE PRESSURE WAS STABILIZED DOMINION BEGAN EXCAVATING.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 P.M. A CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND PRESSURE RESTORED.      THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT LEAKED WAS CUT OUT AND SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR A 3RD PARTY FAILURE ANALYSIS.  THE RESULTS OF THE TEST CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS A THROUGH-WALL INTERNAL CORROSION PIT AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.  TEST RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MICROBIAL-INDUCED CORROSION (MIC) PLAYED A ROLE IN THE PITTING CORROSION.  DOMINION REPLACED APPROXIMATELY 800 FEET OF THE 30"" HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION LINE THAT LEAKED AND WILL REPLACE ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF ADJACENT PIPELINES THROUGHOUT 2015."

MISS DIG TICKETS B42820566 AND B4280561 WERE IDENTIFIED FOR STAKING OF THE EAST SIDE OF N. PITCHER STREET, STARTING AT THE INTERSECTION WITH MOSEL AVENUE AND HEADING SOUTH FOR 2,500 FEET.

THIS AREA IS IMMEDIATELY TO THE SOUTH OF THE DAMAGE LOCATION.    WHILE STAKING WAS EVIDENT BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE DAMAGE LOCATION, THE MARKINGS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE DAMAGE (WITHIN 5 FEET) WERE APPARENTLY NOT SUFFICIENT TO ALERT THE CREW OF THE GAS MAIN'S PRESENCE.    THE DAMAGE LOCATION IS IN A RELATIVELY UNCONGESTED COMMERCIAL AREA.

INCIDENT DESCRIPTION:  ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2014, MILLER PIPELINE CORP., A CONTRACTOR PERFORMING WORK FOR ATMOS ENERGY LOUISIANA DIVISION, WAS SCHEDULED TO DEACTIVATE AND ABANDON A 4"" PE GAS LINE ON HWY 21 @ N. AZALEA IN COVINGTON, LA. THIS WAS A COOL DAY WITH LOW HUMIDITY.    MILLER PIPELINE EMPLOYEE ANTHONY DUNCAN (CREW FOREMAN) WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS WORK AND WAS QUALIFIED IN THE ASSOCIATED OQ TASKS.  - ALL LINE STOPPERS UTILIZED TO BLOCK THE SOURCE OF GAS WERE INSTALLED PREVIOUSLY.  - BEFORE BEGINNING THE PURGING PROCESS, MR. DUNCAN CHECKED TO MAKE SURE ALL SOURCES OF GAS WERE BLOCKED FROM THE GAS LINE TO BE DEACTIVATED.  - AFTER CONFIRMATION THAT ALL SOURCES OF GAS WERE BLOCKED, MR. DUNCAN PROCEEDED TO OPEN THE VALVE (ON PURGE RISER) TO BEGIN DE-PRESSURING AND BLOWING DOWN THE GAS FROM THE LINE. HE WAITED 15 - 20 MINUTES FOR THE LINE TO BLOW DOWN.  - ONCE HE THOUGHT THE LINE WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN DOWN, MR. DUNCAN GOT IN THE EXCAVATION TO REMOVE THE BLOW DOWN RISER. HE USED 2-INCH PLASTIC CUTTERS TO PERFORM THIS TASK. IT WAS DURING THIS PROCESS THAT THE RESIDUAL GAS IN THE PIPE IGNITED AND A FLASH FIRE OCCURRED INJURING MR. DUNCAN.  - MR. DUNCAN WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS HELD OVERNIGHT FOR TREATMENT AND OBSERVATION.    CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT:  IT SEEMS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE GAS LINE TO BE ABANDONED WAS NOT PURGED OF GAS PROPERLY, ALLOWING RESIDUAL GAS TO REMAIN IN THE LINE. SECONDLY, PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL IGNITION WERE NOT FOLLOWED BY NOT PROPERLY GROUNDING THE PIPE OR TOOLS PRIOR TO CUTTING THE PURGE RISER. STATIC ELECTRICITY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF IGNITION OF THE RESIDUAL GAS. THIRDLY, MR. DUNCAN WAS NOT WEARING THE PROPER PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT) FIRE RETARDANT CLOTHING/GLOVES. THIS ADDED PROTECTION COULD HAVE MINIMIZED THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES. FOURTHLY, MR. DUNCAN SENT HIS HELPER (ON FIRE WATCH) AWAY TO PERFORM ANOTHER JOB DUTY. BY HAVING SOMEONE ON FIRE WATCH AT THE EXCAVATION WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER COULD ALSO HAVE MINIMIZED THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES, BY EITHER EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE RIGHT AWAY OR PULLING MR. DUNCAN OUT OF THE EXCAVATION AND AWAY FROM THE FIRE.     ROOT CAUSE:  THERE SEEMS TO BE HUMAN ERROR IN JUDGMENT BY MR. DUNCAN IN SEVERAL INSTANCES INVOLVING FOLLOWING PROCEDURES AND SAFETY POLICIES; THE BELOW FACTORS IN COMBINATION RELATED TO THE CAUSE OF THE FLASH FIRE WHICH RESULTED IN THE INCIDENT:  - DID NOT PURGE NATURAL GAS FROM DEACTIVATED LINE BY USING AIR OR NITROGEN GAS;  - DID NOT CHECK FOR COMPLETE PURGING (0% GAS) OF NATURAL GAS WITH A CGI (COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR) FROM THE PURGE RISER;  - DID NOT PRACTICE PREVENTING STATIC ELECTRICITY HAZARD BY USING SOAPY WATER OR ANTI-STATIC SPRAY AND BURLAP SACK ON PLASTIC PIPE AND ALSO GROUNDING TOOLS PRIOR TO CUTTING PURGE RISER FROM DEACTIVATED PIPE.  THIS ALONG WITH RESIDUAL GAS IN THE DEACTIVATED PIPE RESULTED IN A FLASH FIRE WHICH CAUSED THE INJURY.  - DID NOT WEAR PROPER PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT); FIRE RETARDANT CLOTHING AND GLOVES.  - DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER WORKER AT PURGE LOCATION ON FIRE WATCH WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.     THE ABOVE INSTANCES (WHICH WERE NOT FOLLOWED) ARE COVERED IN ATMOS ENERGY'S O&M PROCEDURES AND SAFETY MANUAL; THEY ARE ALSO COVERED UNDER OQ TASKS L2 - ACTIVATING AND PURGING PIPELINES AND M8 - PREVENTING ACCIDENTAL IGNITION."

THE THIRD PARTY CALLED USA (NO. 459722) ON 11/3/2014.  PG&E RECEIVED THE NORMAL NOTICE ON 11/03/2014 (11:25:55 AM).  IN RESPONSE TO THE TICKET, PG&E ATTEMPTED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE EXCAVATOR BEFORE LOCATING AND MARKING ITS FACILITIES.  PG&E LEFT A MESSAGE FOR THE EXCAVATOR ON 11/5/2014 BUT DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM THE EXCAVATOR TO COORDINATE THE LOCATE AND MARK PRIOR TO THE EXCAVATION. (AS IS CUSTOMARY FOR LARGE EXCAVATION PROJECTS, PG&E COMMUNICATES WITH THE EXCAVATORS TO PHASE THE MARKING OF PG&E FACILITIES TO ENSURE MARKINGS REMAIN VISIBLE IN THE EXCAVATION AREA.) A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (GSR) ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 1131 HOURS. PG&E REPAIR CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1140 HOURS.  GAS WAS COMPLETELY SHUT IN AT 1702 HOURS BY CLOSING 10 DISTRIBUTION MAIN VALVES AND ISOLATING APPROXIMATELY 4 BLOCKS OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND 40 CUSTOMERS. PG&E INITIALLY PLANNED TO SAFELY SQUEEZE THE 2-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC PIPE AT A LOCATION AWAY FROM THE PERIPHERY OF THE DIG-IN LOCATION. UPON FURTHER EVALUATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT DIGGING AND SQUEEZING THE LINE WOULD TAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME DUE TO THE DEPTH EXCEEDING 5 FEET AND THE NEED TO INSTALL SHORING TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. ONCE PG&E ESTIMATED THE TOTAL TIME REQUIRED FOR THE SHUT-IN, PG&E DECIDED TO LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE THAT INCLUDED CLOSING VALVES IN THE SURROUNDING AREA THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE CUSTOMER OUTAGES.  PG&E DETERMINED THAT CLOSING VALVES WAS THE FASTEST AND SAFEST METHOD AND CHOSE TO CLOSE NEARBY VALVES FOR SHUTTING IN GAS FLOW. REPAIR CREW REPLACED THE 4X4X2-INCH TEE AND THE DAMAGED 2-INCH DISTRIBUTION MAIN. ABOUT 2,500 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM OFFICE BUILDINGS ON A TWO-BLOCK AREA OF MARKET AND FIRST AND SAN PEDRO STREETS.

ON CYPRESS LANE IN STAFFORD. AT 9:05 A.M. NEW JERSEY NATURAL GAS (""NJNG"") RECEIVED THE FIRST OF SEVERAL ""NO GAS"" CALLS. THE COMPANY SENT A CREW TO THE AREA. BEFORE THEY REACHED CYPRESS LANE, THE CREW WAS FLAGGED DOWN BY A POLICE OFFICER AT THE INTERSECTION OF OAK AVENUE AND ROUTE 9, WHO INFORMED THEM THAT THERE WAS A GAS ODOR ON OAK AVENUE. THEREAFTER, AT 9:15 A.M. A FIRST RESPONDER WAS DISPATCHED TO OAK AVENUE AND ARRIVED AT ABOUT 9:24 A.M. A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS IDENTIFIED NEAR 59 OAK AVENUE. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT NO ONE WAS IN THE BUILDING. POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL WERE ALREADY ON SITE AND HAD EVACUATED NEIGHBORING HOMES.  SOON THEREAFTER, THREE ADDITIONAL CREWS ARRIVED AT 59 OAK AVENUE. A LEAK IN THE STREET WAS LOCATED AND THE CREWS BEGAN JACKHAMMERING THE PAVEMENT. AT 10:32 A.M., AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED INSIDE 59 OAK AVENUE. PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT APPROXIMATELY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WERE EVACUATED BY FIRE AND POLICE. A REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE WAS MADE IMMEDIATELY. SEVEN NJNG EMPLOYEES WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. FIVE WERE TREATED AND RELEASED AND TWO WERE ADMITTED. THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE AT 11:30 A.M. BY SHUTTING A VALVE TO THE STREET, WHICH AFFECTED ABOUT 335 CUSTOMERS. AT 14:30 (2:30 P.M.), NJNG RECEIVED PERMISSION TO RE-ENTER THE AREA AND REMOVE DEBRIS. THE STREET WAS OPENED IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE LEAK WAS FOUND AND A TWO-INCH (2"") COATED STEEL MAIN WAS FOUND TO BE BROKEN AT THE WELD JOINT. THE BREAK WAS 360° AROUND THE PIPE AND THE PIPE ENDS WERE SEPARATED. APPROXIMATELY TWO FEET OF PIPE ON EACH SIDE OF THE BREAK WAS REMOVED FOR METALLURGICAL EVALUATION.   NJNG BELIEVES THAT THERE WERE THREE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING CAUSES FOR THE FAILURE:  (I) A POOR QUALITY WELD, LACKING ADEQUATE PENETRATION; (II) ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSISTED CRACKING OF THE WELD (E.G., CORROSION); AND (III) EXTERNAL STRESS ON THE GAS MAIN, POSSIBLY FROM POST-INSTALLATION IMPACT, DIFFERENTIAL SOIL SETTLEMENT BELOW THE PIPE, SOIL DISPLACEMENT FROM ADJACENT CONSTRUCTION, ETC.     WITH REFERENCE TO QUESTION NUMBER 2 IN PART D ABOVE, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NJNG HAS RECEIVED NUMEROUS PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, INCLUDING THE OWNER OF 59 OAK AVENUE, IN THE AMOUNT OF $199,000 AND SEVEN NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $75,000.  THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED NOTICE OF OTHER CLAIMS FROM OTHER INSURANCE CARRIERS BUT THESE CARRIERS HAVE NOT INDICATED A LOSS AMOUNT.  THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE COMPANY ULTIMATELY PAYS ON THESE CLAIMS WILL DEPEND ON A FINDING OF LIABILITY AGAINST THE COMPANY AS WELL AS WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGES CLAIMED CAN BE PROVEN BY THE CLAIMANT AND VERIFIED BY THE COMPANY.   A NEW PLASTIC MAIN WAS INSTALLED AND PRESSURIZED ON FEBRUARY 25, 2015 AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 A.M. SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO ALL CUSTOMERS ON FEBRUARY 25, 2015 BY 18:30 (6:30 P.M.).

THE TECHNICIAN VERIFIED THAT NO ONE WAS AT HOME, AND TURNED OFF BOTH THE CURB VALVE TO THE ACTIVE SERVICE LINE AND THE METER VALVE. NO LEAKS WERE FOUND IN THE METER SET ASSEMBLY, BUT SUBSURFACE READINGS INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF GAS AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE.     WHILE THE TECHNICIAN WAS ON THE PREMISES, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED, FOLLOWED BY A FIRE. THE FIRE CONTINUED AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE. ALTHOUGH THE FIRE APPEARED TO BE GAS-FED, IT CONTINUED AFTER THE COMPANY PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTED THE ACTIVE, PLASTIC SERVICE LINE. IN THE COURSE OF SEARCHING FOR POSSIBLE SOURCES OF THE FIRE, THE COMPANY DISCOVERED A DISCONTINUED CUSTOMER-OWNED STEEL SERVICE LINE, WHICH WAS ACCESSED THROUGH A CURB BOX THAT WAS INCORRECTLY LABELED ""WATER."" THE VALVE ON THAT LINE WAS PARTIALLY OPEN, AND THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WAS INADVERTENTLY OPERATED BY A THIRD PARTY ON THE PREVIOUS DAY. THE LINE TERMINATED AT AN ELBOW APPROXIMATELY 38 INCHES BELOW THE SURFACE, NEAR THE BLOCK FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE. SUBSEQUENT TESTING SHOWED A CORROSION LEAK APPROXIMATELY FOUR FEET FROM THE INCORRECTLY LABELED CURB BOX, AND ADDITIONAL EXAMINATION OF THAT FACILITY REVEALED THAT THE ELBOW AT THE TERMINATION OF THE DISCONTINUED CUSTOMER-OWNED SERVICE LINE WAS UNCAPPED. COLUMBIA'S RECORDS DO NOT SHOW TWO SERVICE LINES AT THIS ADDRESS, AND SUBSEQUENT GAS MAIN CAMERA INSPECTIONS, INCLUDING GAS LINE VALVES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE CONNECTIONS TO THE MAIN, CONDUCTED BY COLUMBIA ON SUNNINGDALE WAY AND THE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING STREETS CONFIRMED THAT THE DISCONTINUED AND CONNECTED GAS SERVICE LINE IS AN ANOMALY BECAUSE ALL OTHER GAS MAIN OPENINGS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE COMPANY'S RECORDS. THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO RULE OUT AN UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION OF FACILITIES BY A THIRD PARTY.     AT THIS POINT IN THE INVESTIGATION, COLUMBIA HAS ENOUGH INFORMATION TO FINALIZE ITS INCIDENT REPORT, AND SUBMITS THAT THE INADVERTENT OPERATION OF A GAS VALVE BY A THIRD-PARTY, WHICH WAS ACCESSED THROUGH A CURB BOX THAT WAS INCORRECTLY LABELED ""WATER,"" WHICH ULTIMATELY ALLOWED GAS TO FLOW TO A DISCONTINUED, UNCAPPED SERVICE LINE IS THE LIKELY SERIES OF EVENTS THAT CAUSED THE INCIDENT.      THE COMPANY HAS MADE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO INTERVIEW THE WATER DEPARTMENT AND/OR THE OPERATOR OF ITS SYSTEM IN THAT AREA TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT HAS INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTATION CONCERNING ANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT, AND HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN SECURING AN INTERVIEW.

BETWEEN 2115 AND 2130, THE MACHINE STRUCK A HAWAII GAS (""HG"") UNDERGROUND MAIN LINE, CAUSING AN APPROXIMATELY 9.5-INCH TEAR IN THE MAIN.  THE DAMAGED SEGMENT WAS 4-INCH STEEL PIPE COATED WITH XTC (""SUBJECT SEGMENT""). THE SUBJECT SEGMENT BEGAN TO LEAK GAS AND AT AN UNVERIFIED TIME, THE GAS IGNITED AROUND THE MACHINE. TWO RB EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRE AND ONE REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION. THE HONOLULU FIRE DEPARTMENT (""HFD"") RESPONDED AND DIRECTED WATER AT THE MACHINE TO PREVENT ITS FUEL TANKS FROM OVERHEATING. HG STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE SUBJECT SEGMENT AT APPROXIMATELY 0253 ON 06/16/2015, THE FIRE DISSIPATED SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND HFD ANNOUNCED AN ""ALL CLEAR"" AT APPROXIMATELY 0300.    HG PRE-INCIDENT ACTIVITY    HG INSTALLED THE SUBJECT SEGMENT IN 1977. ON 02/09/2015, RB SUBMITTED ONE CALL TICKET 15001196 (THE ""TICKET"") TO THE HAWAII ONE CALL CENTER STATING THAT RB WOULD BE EXCAVATING AN AREA OF KAPAHULU AVENUE (THE ""EXCAVATION AREA""), INCLUDING THE SUBJECT SEGMENT. HG RESPONDED TO THE TICKET BY REVIEWING EXCAVATION AREA MAPS AND DETERMINING THAT AN UNDERGROUND MAIN WAS LOCATED THEREIN. ON 02/19/2015, HG PERFORMED CONDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE TONING IN THE EXCAVATION AREA AND MARKED THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LINE ON THE ROADWAY SURFACE WITH YELLOW PAINT.    HG RESPONSE TO INCIDENT    HG WAS ALERTED TO THE INCIDENT IN TWO WAYS: 1) THE HG SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS PLANT RECORDED A PRESSURE IRREGULARITY IN THE GAS PIPELINE AND NOTIFIED HG DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 2130; AND 2) HFD NOTIFIED HG DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 2138. AN HG OPERATIONS SUPERINTENDENT ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 2200. OTHER HG PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED BETWEEN 2145 AND 2215, AND BEGAN ARRIVING AT THE HG KAMAKEE BASEYARD BETWEEN 2215 AND 2300. THE HG SUPERVISORY TEAM CONCLUDED THAT THE MAIN LINE WOULD NEED TO BE EXCAVATED AND STOPPED AT THREE LOCATIONS: NORTH, SOUTH AND WEST OF THE INCIDENT. HG PERSONNEL INSTALLED LINE STOPPERS AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH SITES AND PINCHED THE LINE AT THE WEST SITE. GAS FLOW TO THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS STOPPED AT APPROXIMATELY 0253 ON 06/16/15.    STATUTORY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT    (1) HAWAII ONE CALL STATUTE    THE HAWAII ONE CALL STATUTE REQUIRES AN EXCAVATOR TO PROVIDE EXCAVATION LOCATION TO THE ONE CALL CENTER PRIOR TO EXCAVATING, AND THE CENTER NOTIFIES UTILITY OPERATORS ABOUT THE PROPOSED EXCAVATION. THE OPERATOR LOCATES AND MARKS ON THE ROADWAY THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF INSTALLATIONS THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE EXCAVATION, BUT IS NOT REQUIRED TO MARK DEPTH UNDER THE STATUTE. THE EXCAVATOR MUST THEN USE HAND TOOLS TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE INSTALLATION. HERE, HG RESPONDED TO THE TICKET BY REVIEWING MAPS, PERFORMING TONING AND MARKING THE ALIGNMENT--BUT NOT DEPTH--OF THE GAS MAIN IN THE EXCAVATION AREA WITH YELLOW PAINT. HG WAS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE ONE CALL STATUTE. RB DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HAND EXCAVATED AND LOCATED THE SUBJECT SEGMENT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE.    (2) SUBJECT SEGMENT DEPTH    FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN 1977 REQUIRED 24-INCH COVER FOR A MAIN LINE. A MAIN LINE CAN BE INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER IF AN UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE PREVENTS SUCH INSTALLATION AND THE LINE IS PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL PROTECTION. ON 06/16/2015, THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS MEASURED AT APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES BELOW THE ROADWAY SURFACE. IF THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER IN 1977, THE ABOVE EXCEPTION APPLIES. CITY RECORDS INDICATE THAT A CONDUIT STRUCTURE RUNS DIRECTLY BELOW THE SUBJECT SEGMENT, PREVENTING INSTALLATION OF THE SUBJECT SEGMENT AT 24-INCH DEPTH. THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS ENCASED IN CONCRETE, PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION REQUIRED FOR MAINS INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER.    PLEASE CONTACT HG FOR ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE DETAIL IN PDF FORMAT."

THE HOMEOWNER INDICATED A LIGHTNING STRIKE OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 07:34 AND AFTERWARDS A STRONG ODOR OF GAS WAS PRESENT NEAR THE HOME.  THE RESPONDING GAS SERVICE WORKER (GSW) PERFORMED A SERIES OF LEAK TEST AT 10223 DODGE RD., INCLUDING BAR HOLE TESTING THE SERVICE LINE AND THE MAIN.  NO  GAS READS WERE DETECTED AT THIS LOCATION.     THE GSW PROCEEDED TO CHECK FOR GAS READINGS ALONG THE SERVICE LINE AS WELL AS THE BUILDING PERIMETER (DOORS AND WINDOWS) AT 10218 DODGE RD. USING A SENSIT GOLD CGI COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR.  NO READS WERE DETECTED DURING THIS PORTION OF THE INVESTIGATION.    THE GSW EXPANDED THE LEAK INVESTIGATION TO THE LIGHTNING STRIKE LOCATION AT 10209 DODGE RD., AND FOUND 100% GAS READS AT THE EDGE OF PAVEMENT ON BOTH SIDES OF DODGE ROAD AS WELL AS WATER BUBBLING FROM A CRACK IN THE PAVEMENT NEAR THE CENTER OF THE ROAD ABOVE THE SERVICE LINE.      AT APPROXIMATELY 11:15 CONSUMERS ENERGY DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED ON-SITE AND BEGAN PREPARATION TO REPLACE THE SERVICE LINE LOCATED AT 10209 DODGE RD.      AT APPROXIMATELY 12:32 AN EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE OCCURRED AT 10218 DODGE RD. RESULTING IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF PROPERTY.  THE PROPERTY WAS UNOCCUPIED AND NO INJURIES OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.     AFTER THE INCIDENT, CONSUMERS ENERGY CONDUCTED BAR HOLE TESTING IN THE VICINITY OF 10218 DODGE ROAD.   THIS TESTING INDICATED THAT GAS HAD MIGRATED FROM THE LEAK LOCATION AT 10209 DODGE ROAD ALONG THE MAIN TO A LOCATION APPROXIMATELY 20' WEST OF THE IDENTIFIED LEAK.   THE HIGHEST SUSTAINED READS WERE OBTAINED APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET FROM THE LEAK LOCATION AND APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET FROM THE BUILDING WALL.  THE INITIAL READ TAKEN AT 16:00, APPROXIMATELY 3.5 HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION WAS 55%.  A READ TAKEN AT THE SAME LOCATION 2 HOURS LATER (22%) INDICATES THE MIGRATING GAS WAS VENTING AT THIS LOCATION.  THIS LOCATION WAS MONITORED THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND CONTINUED TO VENT. LOWER RESIDUAL GAS READINGS WERE ALSO OBTAINED, BUT AT NO TIME (PRE OR POST-INCIDENT) WERE THERE ANY GAS READINGS AT THE BUILDING WALL OF 10218 DODGE ROAD.      BASED ON THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION SUMMARIZE ABOVE AND OUR INABILITY TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMER'S FUEL LINE AND GAS APPLIANCE(S), CONSUMERS ENERGY FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT 10218 DODGE RD., WAS THE RESULT OF A RELEASE  AND/OR MIGRATION OF CONSUMERS ENERGY'S JURISDICTIONAL GAS."

BASED ON THE INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE, IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS INVESTIGATOR THAT THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WAS UNDETERMINED. THERE WAS A SEVERED NATURAL GAS PIPE INSIDE OF THE GARAGE AND GAS WAS FREE FLOWING INSIDE OF THE GARAGE, WHICH PROVIDED THE FUEL FOR THE IGNITION. THE AREA OF ORIGIN CONTAINED MULTIPLE COMPETENT AND POTENTIAL SOURCES OF ACCIDENTAL IGNITION. THESE INCLUDED ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL DEVICES. AS A RESULT, THE SPECIFIC SOURCE OF IGNITION OF THIS FIRE COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS INVESTIGATION. DURING THIS INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, NO SOURCES OF INCENDIARY IGNITION WERE OBSERVED OR INDICATED IN THE AREA OF ORIGIN.

THE SERVICE WAS EXCAVATED BY THE CREW FORMAN. THE WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) ON THE CREW RETIRED THE SERVICE BY CUTTING THE SERVICE ABOUT 4 INCHES FROM THE TAPPING TEE WITH A SET OF FOUR WHEEL CUTTERS, AND THEN INSERTED A LEAK SCREW IN THE SERVICE, AND WELDED IT UP.  AFTER WELDING THE LEAK SCREW IN, THEY CHECKED FOR LEAKS AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) THEN BUFFED THE TEE AND MAIN OFF WITH A BUFFER TO PREPARE IT TO BE RE-COATED AND CHECKED FOR LEAKS A SECOND TIME. AFTER CHECKING FOR LEAKS AGAIN WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) FOUND A SMALL LEAK ON THE TAPPING TEE. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TRIED TO WELD THE LEAK UP BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. AFTER FAILING TO REPAIR THE LEAK ON THE TAPPING TEE THE CREW FORMAN INSTRUCTED WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TO REMOVE THE TAPPING TEE AND INSTALL A LEAK SCREW IN THE MAIN TO ELIMINATE THE LEAK. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) USED AN ELECTRIC BAND SAW TO CUT THE TEE OFF THE MAIN. WHILE CUTTING THE TEE OFF THE MAIN THE GAS IGNITED, AND WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) ESCAPED OUT OF THE HOLE WHILE RECEIVING BURNS TO HIS LEFT ARM, NECK, AND FACE.  IN THE PRECONSTRUCTION MEETING, THE GAS DISTRIBUTION/CONSTRUCTION SUPERINTENDENT INSTRUCTED THE CREW FORMAN NOT TO USE THE ELECTRIC BAND SAW WHILE RETIRING THIS SERVICE. THE DISTRIBUTION/CONSTRUCTION SUPERINTENDENT TOLD THE CREW FORMAN THIS WHILE GIVING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DAY OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2015. THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS CONVERSATION.   AT 11:26AM THE CREW FORMAN CALLED THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR AND TOLD HIM THAT WELDER 1 THE INJURED EMPLOYEE HAD RECEIVED BURNS AND THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR ARRIVED WITHIN FIVE MINUTES, AND TOOK WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. SERVICE WORKER A CALLED WELDER 2 WHO ARRIVED WITH IN TWENTY MINUTES TO THE JOB SITE. WELDER 2 INSTALLED AND WELDED A LEAK SCREW IN THE MAIN TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS. GAS WAS RELEASED FOR NO MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES.   AT APPROXIMATELY 12:05PM IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INJURED EMPLOYEE WOULD NEED HOSPITALIZATION AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO GRADY HOSPITAL IN ATLANTA AROUND 1:30PM.  THE INJURED EMPLOYEE WAS HOSPITALIZED, NO PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND NO EVACUATIONS.  THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR CONTACTED CHRIS SWAN WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AT 12:39PM AS PER COMMISSION RULE.

THE EPICENTER WAS IN COOK INLET, 162 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE CITY OF ANCHORAGE.      AT APPROXIMATELY 0225, ENSTAR NATURAL GAS COMPANY RECEIVED A CALL TO ITS CALL CENTER FROM EMERGENCY RESPONDERS NOTIFYING IT OF AN IGNITION AND FIRE AT A RESIDENCE LOCATED AT 1213 LILAC LANE IN KENAI, ALASKA.  ENSTAR'S FIRST RESPONDING EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 0238.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, FIRE CREWS EXTINGUISHED THE INITIAL FIRE.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE HOURS, CREWS WORKED WITH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO EVACUATE THE STREET, SHUT DOWN ELECTRICITY TO STRUCTURES ON THE STREET, AND LOCATE THE GAS LEAK.  CREWS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS AN UNDERGROUND GAS LEAK IN FRONT OF 1213 LILAC LANE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 4 A.M., CREWS BEGAN EXCAVATING AT THE SITE OF THE SUSPECTED GAS LEAK.  THE GROUND WAS FROZEN, WITH FROST EXTENDING 2-4 FEET BELOW THE SURFACE, AND THE MAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET DEEP AT THIS LOCATION.  DURING THE EXCAVATION, AT APPROXIMATELY 0554, A SECONDARY IGNITION OCCURRED AT 1215 LILAC LANE.  THE ENSUING FIRE DAMAGED THE HOMES AT 1211, 1213, 1215, AND 1217 LILAC LANE.  CREWS SHUT DOWN THE MAIN ON LILAC LANE BY STOPPING GAS FLOW TO THE THREE TIE-IN POINTS THAT FED THE STREET.  CREWS DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS A 1 1/4 INCH STEEL MAIN THAT HAD SEPARATED AT A WELD JOINT.  CREWS REPAIRED THE BROKEN MAIN AND RESTORED SERVICE TO NON-AFFECTED HOMES AT APPROXIMATELY 1800. THROUGHOUT THE DAY, ADDITIONAL ENSTAR CREWS WERE CALLED IN FROM THE KENAI AND ANCHORAGE AREAS TO SUPPORT THE RESPONSE.

THE COMPANY ORDERED A 44 INCH LONG STEEL, SPLIT SLEEVE ENCAPSULATION FITTING AS AN ALTERNATE REPAIR. THE ENCAPSULATION FITTING REQUIRED ADDITIONAL EXCAVATION OF THE PIPE WHICH UNCOVERED A THIRD CRACK 16 INCHES LONG. THE ENCAPSULATION FITTING WAS SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED AROUND THE ORIGINAL TWO CRACKS.

THE GAS STATION HAS BEEN UNDER REMEDIATION FOR A LARGE PETROLEUM RELEASE FROM UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS. ACCORDING TO INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED BY THE ASHLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYEES AT THE PROPERTY, AS WELL AS PATRONS OF THE STORE PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, A CHEMICAL ODOR, NOT NATURAL GAS, WAS SMELLED ON SITE.    A  COLUMBIA SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS ON SITE TO SET A GAS METER AT THE GAS STATION THE DAY PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, MAY 2, 2016.  COLUMBIA'S TECHNICIAN FOUND THE SERVICE LINE CURB VALVE IN THE ""OFF"" POSITION WHEN HE ARRIVED ON SITE. THE TECHNICIAN TURNED THE CURB VALVE TO THE ""ON"" POSITION BRIEFLY TO DETERMINE IF THE GAS SERVICE WAS ACTIVE, AND PROMPTLY TURNED THE CURB VALVE BACK TO THE ""OFF"" POSITION WHEN NO GAS WAS FOUND AT THE METER SETTING. THE CURB VALVE'S ""OFF"" POSITION WAS VERIFIED WHEN EXCAVATED FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT.    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, ON MAY 3, 2016, THE CURB VALVE AND THE CUSTOMER-OWNED SERVICE LINE WERE EXPOSED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE SERVICE LINE DOWNSTREAM OF THE CURB VALVE HAD BEEN SEVERED PRIOR TO THE MAY 2, 2016 SITE VISIT BY COLUMBIA. COLUMBIA TESTED THE CURB VALVE AND THE SERVICE LINE FROM THE MAIN UP TO THE CURB VALVE AND FOUND NO GAS LEAKAGE.      ON WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 2016, COLUMBIA, ALONG WITH OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES, TOOK SAMPLES FROM SIX (6) LOCATIONS UNDER THE CONCRETE PAD OF THE STRUCTURE.  THE RESULTS OF THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT VERY LOW LEVELS OF DEGRADED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND VERY LOW LEVELS OF NATURAL GAS WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME THE SAMPLES WERE TAKEN.            COLUMBIA HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED TO ANY REASONABLE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY.  PLEASE CONSIDER THIS REPORT A FINAL REPORT."

THIS SERVICE LINE CONNECTION WAS REPAIRED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW SERVICE LINE AND TAP ON MAY 6, 2016. THIS NEW SERVICE LINE AND CONNECTION DID NOT LEAK AFTER MAY 6. THERE WAS NO CRACK IN THE CAST IRON MAIN AT THE TIME THAT THE MAY 6 SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT WAS COMPLETED; THE INSPECTION AT THAT TIME DID NOT REVEAL A LOSS OF SUPPORT UNDER THE CAST IRON MAIN. SERVICE TO 2437 FAIRFIELD WAS LEFT OFF AT THE TIME OF THIS REPAIR DUE TO CUSTOMER NOT BEING HOME. ON MAY 23, 2016 A CENTERPOINT ENERGY EMPLOYEE RETURNED TO RESTORE SERVICE TO THIS RESIDENCE AT THE CUSTOMER'S REQUEST. DURING THIS RESTORATION A BAR HOLE INSPECTION WAS MADE IN WHICH THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A LEAK. ON MAY 26, 2016 A CENTERPOINT ENERGY CONTRACT SERVICES INSPECTOR WENT BACK TO SITE OF THE SERVICE LINE REPAIR AND PERFORMED A VISUAL INSPECTION, AND AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A LEAK. ON JULY 31, 2016 AT APP. 16:18, CENTERPOINT ENERGY WAS NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED TO TWO EMERGENCY CALLS REPORTED AT 2437 FAIRFIELD AVE. AN EMERGENCY LEAK INVESTIGATION ORDER AND AN EMERGENCY FIRE INVESTIGATION ORDER WERE CREATED. TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT APP. 16:53 TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION. DURING THE INVESTIGATION OF JULY 31, GAS WAS DETECTED NEAR THE STRUCTURE, AFTER WHICH TELEPHONIC REPORTS WERE MADE TO NRC AND STATE REGULATORY OFFICIALS. DURING ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT, A FRACTURE WAS FOUND AUGUST 2, 2016, ON THE CAST IRON MAIN AT A LOCATION OF AN ADJACENT STEEL SERVICE LINE TAP, WHICH WAS 2.8' AWAY FROM THE NEWLY INSTALLED POLY SERVICE LINE TAP. METALLURGICAL INSPECTION OF JANUARY 18, 2017, SHOWED THAT THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS/STRENGTH WAS WELL PRESERVED WITHOUT ANY GRAPHITIC CORROSION BEYOND SHALLOW SURFACE CORROSION. THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AND SUBSEQUENT GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE PIPE FRACTURED DUE TO A RECENT OVERLOAD EVENT OCCURRING AFTER A LOSS OF SUPPORT, MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY LOSS OF SOIL BY WATER INFILTRATION AND EROSION THROUGH THE VOIDS, CRACKS AND OPENINGS AROUND THE VARIOUS SEWER LINE CONNECTIONS IN THE SEWER MANHOLE AND ON THE MANHOLE WALL ITSELF. THE FRACTURE OCCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MAY 26, 2016 INSPECTION AND BEFORE THE JULY 31, 2016 INCIDENT. THE GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE CAST-IRON MAIN LINE UNDERWENT DEFLECTIONS DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF THE LOSS OF SOIL SUPPORT FROM THE SOIL CAVING, RESULTING IN AN UNDETECTED INCREASE IN STRESSES IN THE MAIN PIPE AT THE LOCATION OF THE CONNECTION OF THE STEEL SERVICE LINE WHERE THE CRACK OCCURRED. THE ODOR OF NATURAL GAS WAS DETECTED BY PERSONS PRESENT AT THE SUBJECT PROPERTY ON JULY 29, JULY 30 AND THE MORNING OF JULY 31 WITHOUT ANYONE CONTACTING CENTERPOINT BEFORE THE FIRE OCCURRED."

IN EARLY 2016, ENTERGY FOSSIL GROUP REQUESTED ENOI GAS OPERATIONS TO PHYSICALLY SEPARATE THE TWO GAS SERVICES THAT DELIVERED GAS FROM THE ENOI DISTRIBUTION MAIN ON PARIS RD TO THE GENERATING UNITS FROM THE POWER PLANT.  ALL GAS WORK WAS PERFORMED BY ENOI GAS OPERATION PERSONNEL.  THE SCOPE OF WORK WAS TO CLOSE THE SERVICE VALVES SERVING THE PLANT, PURGE THE SERVICE LINES, CUT AND WELD A STEEL CAP ON BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM ENDS TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL SEPARATION. INITIAL WORK WAS ON THE 20 INCH LINE FEEDING MICHOUD UNITS 1 AND 2.  PRIMARY WORK ONSITE WAS:  1. EXCAVATING THE SERVICE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE LINE.  EXCAVATION DIMENSIONS WERE APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET WIDE BY 15 FEET LONG BY 8 FEET DEEP TO ALLOW FOR COMPLETE 360° ACCESS TO SERVICE.  2. PURGING THE SERVICE LINE WITH INERT GAS, AND THEN GAPPING THE SERVICE TO ISOLATE THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT INTO THE PLANT.  3. WELDING STEEL CAPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NEW GAP.  4. OPENING THE SERVICE VALVE TO RE-PRESSURIZE THE SERVICE LINE UPSTREAM OF THE GAP.  WITHIN 3 MINUTES OF HAVING THE UPSTREAM VALVE FULLY OPEN, THE PRESSURE RELEASE OCCURRED (13:10 CST).  APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET UPSTREAM OF THE EXCAVATION, THE GAPPED SERVICE SEGMENT WAS BLOWN OUT OF A STRAPPED STYLE 40 DRESSER COUPLING.  THE SERVICE VALVE WAS CLOSED WITHIN 7 MINUTES.  THE RESULT OF THE BLOWOUT BUCKLED AND CRACKED CONCRETE ROADWAY, BLEW ALL THE DIRT UNDERNEATH ROADWAY AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE COUPLING INTO AND OUT OF THE EXCAVATION.

THE MAIN WAS FOUND TO BE IN CONTACT WITH ROCKS WHICH IN TURN HAD CAUSED THE PIPE TO CORRODE.  NO DISBANDING OR OTHER PIPE DAMAGE WAS FOUND DURING THE INVESTIGATION.  SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL: IN PART A INDICATED IGNITION = YES.  THERE WAS A FLASH EXPLOSION THAT DID NOT RESULT IN SUSTAINED FIRE, SO ORIGINAL REPORT INDICATED NO IGNITION."

A PGS TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND WHILE IN ROUTE, HE RECEIVED A FOLLOW-UP TELEPHONE CALL FROM PIKE ELECTRIC, WHICH INFORMED HIM THAT ESCAPING NATURAL GAS FROM THE PIPELINE HAD IGNITED. PGS DISPATCHED THE REPAIR CONTRACTOR.     THE DAMAGED LINE WAS A 6-INCH NATURAL GAS PLASTIC MAIN THAT PROVIDED SERVICE TO APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOMES.  THE GAS PIPELINE WAS VERIFIED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT PRESSURE TO PREVENT AN INTERRUPTION TO THE DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS DURING THE LEAK.   THE BONITA SPRINGS FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO CONTAIN THE FIRE FROM SPREADING, AND PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE.  THE ASSISTANT FIRE CHIEF CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COULD CONTROL THE FIRE WHILE PGS WORKED TO INSTALL A BYPASS LINE (A BYPASS LINE WAS INSTALLED TO PREVENT AN INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE TO THE DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS WHEN THE GAS MAIN WAS SQUEEZED OFF).  THE BYPASS LINE WAS PLACED IN SERVICE AT APPROXIMATELY 03:00 ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2016.  AFTER THIS INSTALLATION, GAS SERVICE TO THE DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS WAS THEN BEING SUPPLIED VIA A COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS TRAILER.

PGS RECEIVED THE SUNSHINE 811 NOTIFICATIONS, AND MARKED THE PIPELINE VIA A SPRAY PAINT OFFSET INDICATION AND YELLOW FLAGS, AS REQUIRED.  THE PIPELINE WAS UNDETECTABLE USING THE TRACER WIRE, SO PGS USED MAPS TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF THE PIPELINE.  THE PIPELINE MARKINGS WERE VERIFIED AS ACCURATE.

THE LINE FLASH FIRED WHEN THE POLY PIPE WAS IN PLACE BUT NOT YET JOINED TO THE STEEL PIPE.     WHEN THE FLASH FIRE OCCURRED THERE WERE THREE EMPLOYEE OPERATORS IN THE EXPOSED EXCAVATION THAT WERE BURNED. ALL THREE WORKERS WERE TRANSPORTED FOR INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION TREATMENT AT A REGIONAL BURN CENTER VIA AIR AMBULANCES.    THE TEXAS STATE FIRE MARSHALL AND REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION WERE CALLED TO THE SCENE. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INDICATES THE POSSIBLE IGNITION SOURCE OF THE NATURAL GAS TO BE STATIC ELECTRICITY.     MOVING FORWARD THE OPERATOR PLANS TO REDUCE THE RISKS OF THIS TYPE OF EVENT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE BY: 1) PURCHASING AND UTILIZING LINE STOPPING EQUIPMENT. 2) PURCHASING AND UTILIZING FIRE RESISTANT CLOTHING DURING REPAIRS. 3) HAVING A SAFETY OFFICER PRESENT AT GAS LINE REPAIRS TO ENSURE THE SCENE, OPERATIONS, AND PROCEDURES ARE BEING FOLLOWED IN AN EFFORT TO MITIGATE RISKS FOR BOTH WORKERS AND CUSTOMERS."

ON DECEMBER 16, 2016, ON THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION OF WEST KELLI AVE. AND HWY 62 (MAIN ST.) IN FARMINGTON, ARKANSAS, A VEHICLE TRAVELLING WEST ON HWY 62 LEFT THE ROADWAY AND STRUCK A BLACK HILLS ENERGY ARKANSAS, INC. (""BHEA"" OR THE ""COMPANY"") 2-INCH POST REGULATOR SETTING THAT WAS CONNECTED TO A 4-INCH TRANSMISSION PIPELINE.  THE REGULATOR SETTING WAS LOCATED 28.5 FEET FROM THE CURB OF HWY 62.  THE IMPACT OF THE CAR STRIKING THE SETTING BROKE TWO 2"" X 1"" SWAGES ON THE HIGH PRESSURE SIDE OF THE REGULATOR AND TWO 2"" STEEL PIPES ON THE INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE SIDE OF THE REGULATOR.  THE GAS ESCAPING FROM THE BROKEN PORTIONS OF THE REGULATOR SETTING IGNITED IMMEDIATELY, RESULTING IN A LARGE FIRE.  THE FIRST BHEA EMPLOYEES ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 4:00 P.M. AND 4:10 P.M., AND STARTED THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE EFFECTED SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY'S SYSTEM WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FARMINGTON AND FAYETTEVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENTS.  THE EMERGENCY SHUT OFF VALVE FOR THE SETTING, WHICH WAS LOCATED 21 FEET FROM THE SETTING, WAS INACCESSIBLE DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE FIRE.   RATHER THAN STOP THE FIRE BY COMPLETELY SHUTTING OFF THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE PORTION OF BHEA'S SYSTEM IN THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN LOSS OF SERVICE TO HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS, BHEA DECIDED, BASED ON ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, TO TAKE MEASURES TO REDUCE OR STOP THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE ISOLATED PORTION OF ITS SYSTEM FEEDING INTO THE REGULATOR SETTING IN ORDER TO STOP THE FIRE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME AVOIDING LOSS OF SERVICE TO ITS CUSTOMERS.  THIS DECISION WAS MADE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN BHEA AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS THAT RESPONDED TO THE SCENE, DURING WHICH ALL PARTIES AGREED THAT THERE WERE NO IMPENDING RISKS TO HUMAN LIFE OR PROPERTY, SINCE THE PERSON THAT WAS APPARENTLY IN THE CAR THAT STRUCK THE REGULATOR SETTING WAS EITHER DECEASED PRIOR TO THE CAR HITTING THE SETTING OR DIED WHEN THE FIRE ERUPTED*, THE OCCUPANTS OF A NEARBY DUPLEX THAT HAD CAUGHT FIRE HAD BEEN SAFELY EVACUATED, AND NO OTHER LIVES WERE IN DANGER.  REGARDING PROPERTY, AS MENTIONED, A DUPLEX NEXT TO THE REGULATOR SETTING HAD CAUGHT FIRE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CAR HIT THE SETTING AND THE FIRE BEGAN, AND IT WAS QUICKLY APPARENT THAT IT COULD NOT BE SAVED FROM TOTAL LOSS.  THERE WAS NO OTHER IMMINENT RISK TO PROPERTY, GIVEN THE FIRE WAS UNDER CONTROL AND WAS NOT SPREADING.  IN ADDITION, BHEA WAS AWARE THAT THE WEATHER WAS FORECASTED TO TURN VERY COLD THE FOLLOWING DAY, WITH TEMPERATURES FORECASTED TO FALL INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS BY THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, MAKING ANY LOSS OF GAS SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS ALL THE MORE CONSEQUENTIAL.    BECAUSE GAS WAS FEEDING INTO THE SETTING FROM FOUR DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE SETTING TOOK SEVERAL HOURS, AND WAS COMPLETED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:40 A.M. ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17.  AFTER THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS COMPLETED THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THE DAMAGED FACILITIES, BHEA BEGAN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING THE SETTING IN ORDER TO BRING THE SEGMENT OF THE SYSTEM BACK INTO SERVICE, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT 1:15 P.M. ON SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17.  *THERE WAS APPARENTLY ONE PERSON IN THE CAR AT THE TIME IT HIT THE REGULATOR SETTING.  FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, BONE FRAGMENTS FROM THAT PERSON WERE FOUND IN THE CAR.  THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, AND AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, NEITHER THE CAUSE OF DEATH, NOR THE TIME OF DEATH (EITHER BEFORE THE INCIDENT OR AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT) HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.  UNTIL THE RESULTS OF THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES' INVESTIGATIONS ARE RELEASED, BHEA HAS STATED ON THIS REPORT TO PHMSA THAT THERE WERE NO FATALITIES THAT RESULTED FROM THE INCIDENT.  BHEA WILL UPDATE THIS REPORT ONCE IT RECEIVES FURTHER INFORMATION."

BRADLEY ATKINS (SOUTHEASTERN NATURAL GAS SERVICES OF ROME) WAS IN THE HOLE AND HAD A 2"" STEEL GAS LINE EXPOSED WITH A SHORT SECTION CUT OUT. AT THE TIME I ARRIVED HE STILL HAD GAS BLEEDING FROM THE SOUTH END OF THE LINE WHERE HE WAS WELDING ON SOMETHING AND GAS FROM THE NORTH END OF THE LINE WHICH WAS OPEN AND HAD BEEN SET ON FIRE. I SPOKE WITH BRADLEY AND HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT THERE MUST BE ANOTHER FEED ON THE NORTH END OF THE LINE SO I TOLD HIM I WOULD SEE IF I COULD FIND WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.   4:35 PM: I ASKED SHANE FERGUSON TO PULL THE BACKHOE TO A VALVE ABOUT 100 FEET NORTH OF THE HOLE WHERE THE LINE WAS EXPOSED. I WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD TRIED TO OPERATE THE VALVE AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS STRIPED. I INSTRUCTED SHANE TO DIG THE VALVE UP. ONCE THE VALVE WAS EXPOSED I PUT A PIPE WRENCH ON THE VALVE TO SEE IF IT WOULD MOVE AND PARTIALLY OPERATED IT.   4:45 PM: I RETURNED TO THE HOLE WHERE THE LINE WAS EXPOSED AND SOMEONE TOLD ME BRADLEY HAD BEEN BURNED.  BRADLEY WAS OVER AT HIS TRUCK SO I WALKED OVER AND ASKED HIM IF HE WAS OK, HE SAID HE WAS FINE BUT I TOLD HIM HE NEEDED TO GET CHECKED OUT. BRADLEY WANTED HIS WIFE TO DRIVE HIM TO THE DOCTOR SO WHILE WE WERE WAITING BRADLEY GAVE ME INSTRUCTIONS TO GIVE TO LONNIE TANNER WHO WAS COMING TO FINISH THE JOB. I WROTE THE INSTRUCTIONS DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER.   5:15 PM:  BRADLEY LEFT FOR THE HOSPITAL WITH HIS WIFE.    5:20 PM:  AT THIS TIME WE PINCHED OFF THE LINE WHICH WAS STILL BURNING ON THE NORTH SECTION OF THE CUT OUT SECTION AND THE GAS HAD BLED OFF OF THE SOUTH END OF THE LINE. I WALKED OVER ACROSS HIGHWAY 140 TO THE REGULATOR STATION FEEDING SHAW TO SEE IF I COULD FIGURE OUT WHERE THE GAS WHICH WAS STILL ON THE NORTH END OF THE LINE WAS COMING FROM. AT THE REGULATOR STATION SOUTHEASTERN NATURAL GAS SERVICES OF ROME HAD TAKEN OUT A 1/4"" PLUG ON THE INLET SIDE OF REGULATOR WHICH WAS STILL BLEEDING GAS OFF THE LINE ON THE NORTH SECTION OF LINE. A 2"" VALVE ON THE OUTLET SIDE TO SHAW HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY TURNED OFF TRAPPING THE LINE PACK BETWEEN THE REGULATOR STATION AND SHAW WHICH IS ABOUT 350 FEET OF 4"" HDPE LINE.   5:35 PM:  I BLED THE GAS OFF ON THE SHAW SIDE OF REGULATOR STATION AND THE GAS ALSO STOPPED ON THE BLEEDING PLUG ON THE INLET SIDE SO THE GAS HAD BEEN BLEEDING BACK THROUGH A VALVE ON THE REGULATOR STATION. ALL THE GAS WAS OFF BOTH ENDS OF THE LINE BY 5:45 PM.  5:45 PM: WE WAITED FOR LONNIE TANNER TO ARRIVE.  6:15 PM:  LONNIE TANNER ARRIVED AND I GAVE HIM THE PAPER WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH BRADLEY HAD LEFT FOR HIM.

IN DALLAS.  ATMOS ENERGY'S FIRST RESPONDERS ARRIVED ON-SITE AT 3:20 PM DISCOVERING A THIRD PARTY DAMAGE AND GAS IGNITION HAD OCCURRED ON A 6"" POLY MAIN STRUCK BY A TRUCK-MOUNTED AUGER NORTHWEST OF THE INTERSECTION OF MAIN STREET AND CESAR CHAVEZ BOULEVARD.  ATMOS ENERGY PERSONNEL  ELIMINATED GAS FLOW TO THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPE - ISOLATION POINTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND LOCATED, AND THE VALVES WERE CLOSED AT 4:09 PM.  ALL OF THE ROADS EXCEPT THE 2100 BLOCK OF MAIN STREET WERE REOPENED.  AS A RESULT OF THE MAIN ISOLATION, TWO COMMERCIAL SERVICES WERE TEMPORARILY INTERRUPTED.  GAS FLOW WAS REINSTATED AT 12:20 AM (MARCH11TH) ALLOWING THE INTERRUPTED SERVICES TO BE RESTORED.  APPROXIMATELY 29 YARDS OF MAIN WAS DEACTIVATED AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.  THE 2100 BLOCK OF MAIN STREET WAS REOPENED UPON COMPLETION OF THE DEACTIVATION.    FIRST RESPONDERS WERE NOTIFIED BY DALLAS FIRE & RESCUE THAT APPROXIMATELY 25 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM THE ADDRESSES OF 2121 MAIN ST. AND 2108 MAIN ST.  AN AREA SURROUNDING THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT WAS CORDONED OFF, FROM US 75 TO PEARL STREET TO PACIFIC AVENUE TO JACKSON STREET.      THIS 6"" POLY MAIN HAD BEEN INSTALLED AND HAD BEEN PLACED IN SERVICE ON FEBRUARY 27, 2017.  THE CONTRACTORS ON ATMOS ENERGY'S PROJECT AND THE CITY OF DALLAS' PROJECT WERE WORKING SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE SAME AREA IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE INCIDENT.  ATMOS ENERGY FOLLOWED IT APPROVED PROCEDURES, IN COMPLIANCE WITH PART 192.603(B), TO RECORD THIS NEW ASSET IN THE GIS ELECTRONIC MAPPING SYSTEM USED BY ITS LOCATORS.  DUE TO THE TIME IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THIS PROCESS, THIS ASSET WAS NOT REFLECTED IN THE ELECTRONIC MAPPING AT THE TIME THE LOCATE TICKET WAS COMPLETED IN THIS AREA ON MARCH 3, 2017.  AS A RESULT, THE NEW ASSET WAS NOT MARKED WITH THE LOCATE TICKET.  HOWEVER, THERE WERE EXISTING VISUAL INDICATORS IN PLACE, INCLUDING A FRESH DITCH LINE COVERED WITH NEW ASPHALT IN-LINE WITH THE POINT OF DAMAGE; VISIBLE AND YELLOW PAINTED GAS VALVE BOXES ON MAIN STREET 15 YARDS FROM THE POINT OF DAMAGE; AND A LARGE CAPACITY METER IN THE ALLEY FOR 2121 MAIN STREET.  BECAUSE THE THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTOR HAD AN OBLIGATION PER 18 TAC 18.4 TO MAKE A VISUAL CHECK FOR ANY UNMARKED UNDERGROUND PIPELINES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ABOVE-GROUND PIPELINE VALVES, METER SETS, AND OTHER VISUAL MARKINGS, THE PRIMARY CAUSE THAT LED TO THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE INSUFFICIENT EXCAVATION PRACTICES.

CONSUMERS ENERGY PERSONNEL ARRIVED ONSIDE AT APPROXIMATELY 08:15. IT WAS FOUND THAT WITH THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS THROUGH THE RELIEF VALVE, AN OIL-LIKE SUBSTANCE WAS ALSO RELEASED. THIS SUBSTANCE AFFECTED 3 HOMES AND A FARMERS FIELD NEARBY. LAB ANALYSIS HAS DETERMINED THIS SUBSTANCE WAS COMPRISED OF MID-RANGE AND HEAVY HYDROCARBONS.    THE FACILITY WAS OPERATING PROPERLY ON THE SECONDARY RUN WHEN PERSONNEL ARRIVED WITHIN NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURES. THE REGULATOR FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY AN INFLUX OF HYDROCARBONS AFFECTING THE FUNCTION OF THE REGULATORS. CONSUMERS ENERGY CREW REBUILT THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RUN REGULATORS AND PILOTS AT THE CITY GATE AND RE-TESTED THE RELIEF VALVE. ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL COMPLETED LEAK SURVEY AND FOUND NO LEAKS. PERSONNEL ALSO CHECKED SURROUNDING REGULATOR STATIONS AND ALL WERE FOUND TO BE OPERATING CORRECTLY. ALL WORK WAS COMPLETED BY 19:15 ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2017.    CONSUMERS ENERGY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH A THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTOR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP. THE DEQ WAS NOTIFIED AT 13:00 ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2017. ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP HAS BEEN COMPLETED.     AFTER LAB ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION, THE CAUSE/SOURCE OF THE HYDROCARBONS IS BELIEVED TO BE A RESULT OF FREE LIQUIDS FROM STORAGE FIELDS, AND LIQUIDS NOT RECOVERED IN PIGGING OPERATIONS. CONSUMERS ENERGY HAS PROVIDED THESE SOURCES AND AFFILIATED ACTION PLANS TO THE MPSC."

[REFERENCE TO FIGURE REMOVED]  AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION, TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE KILLED AND NINE WERE INJURED. AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, TWO WORKERS WERE INSTALLING NEW PIPING TO SUPPORT THE RELOCATION OF GAS METERS FROM THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING TO THE OUTSIDE. TWO NEW METERS MOUNTED ON A WALL WERE READY FOR THE NEW PIPING TO BE CONNECTED. WHILE WORKERS WERE REMOVING THE EXISTING PIPING, A FULL-FLOW NATURAL GAS LINE AT PRESSURE WAS OPENED. THE WORKERS WERE UNABLE TO MITIGATE THE RELEASE OF THE GAS, SO THEY EVACUATED THE AREA. HTTPS://WWW.NTSB.GOV/INVESTIGATIONS/ACCIDENTREPORTS/PAGES/DCA17MP007-PRELIM-REPORT.ASPX     FINAL UPDATE AS OF 1/21/2020    ON DECEMBER 4, 2019, THE NTSB RELEASED THE PUBLIC DOCKET FOR ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT.  AS DESCRIBED IN THE DOCUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE PUBLIC DOCKET, THE NTSB FOUND THAT THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS AT MINNEHAHA ACADEMY OCCURRED WHEN MASTER MECHANICAL DISASSEMBLED EXISTING PIPING IN THE ACADEMY'S BOILER ROOM.  THE MASTER MECHANICAL PERSONNEL BELIEVED A 3-INCH WALWORTH PLUG VALVE UPSTREAM OF THE DISASSEMBLED EXISTING PIPING WAS IN THE CLOSED POSITION ON THE DAY OF THE EXPLOSION, WHEN IN FACT IT WAS OPEN.  THE NTSB ALSO PERFORMED A POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE TAKEN FROM THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION AND FOUND THAT INDICATORS ON THE 3-INCH WALWORTH PLUG VALVE CONFIRMED THAT THE VALVE'S ORIENTATION WAS IN THE OPEN POSITION.  THE NTSB ALSO NOTED THAT ""CONFIRMATION OF WHETHER THE VALVE IS OPEN OR CLOSED IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CREW WORKING ON THE PIPING.  THIS CONFIRMATION WOULD ENTAIL REMOVAL OF THE HANDLE AND NOTING THE POSITION OF THE PLUG ASSEMBLY.""  THE MASTER MECHANICAL PERSONNEL DID NOT PERFORM EITHER OF THESE FUNCTIONS TO CONFIRM THE ORIENTATION OF THE VALVE ON THE DAY OF THE EXPLOSION. AS NOTED IN PARD D 2A OF THIS REPORT, THE EXPLOSION CAUSED AN ESTIMATED $48 MILLION IN ""PROPERTY DAMAGE"" (AS DEFINED IN PHMSA F7100.1) TO THE SCHOOL. THIS FIGURE IS BASED ON ESTIMATES FROM THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL'S PROPERTY INSURER.    IN ITS DECEMBER 6, 2019 ACCIDENT BRIEF, THE NTSB STATED THAT ""THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE NATURAL GAS EXPLOSION AT THE MINNEHAHA ACADEMY WAS THE DISASSEMBLING OF PIPING UPSTREAM OF A GAS SERVICE METER IN THE BUILDING BY A PIPEFITTING CREW [MASTER MECHANICAL], RESULTING IN THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY IGNITED.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE LACK OF DETAILED DOCUMENTATION THAT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THE SCOPE OF WORK TO BE PERFORMED."""

AN EXPLOSION WAS REPORTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRE.  THERE WERE THREE (3) OCCUPANTS IN THE HOME AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  ONE OCCUPANT RECEIVED INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION.      AT APPROXIMATELY 8:34 P.M. (CST), MIDDLE TENNESSEE NATURAL GAS UTILITY DISTRICT (MTNGUD) RECEIVED A REPORT OF A FIRE AND EXPLOSION AT 266 ROMA DRIVE, CROSSVILLE, TENNESSEE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 8:40 P.M. (CST) TWO MTNGUD SERVICE TECHNICIANS ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE ON THE SCENE.  THE HOUSE WAS IN FLAMES.    AT APPROXIMATELY AT 8:45 P.M. (CST), THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS CUT AND CAPPED THE THREE-QUARTER INCH (3/4"") P.E. SERVICE LINE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY (30) FEET FROM THE HOUSE.  A REMOTE METHANE LEAK DETECTION SURVEY WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS.  THE SURVEY DETECTED A SLIGHT READING WHICH DISSIPATED FOLLOWING THE CAPPING OF THE SERVICE LINE.  BEFORE THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS LEFT THE SCENE THEY REMOVED THE GAS METER AND REGULATOR WHICH WERE DAMAGED BEYOND USE IN THIS INCIDENT.  MTNGUD TECHNICIANS DID NOT INVESTIGATE ANY PIPE DOWNSTREAM OF THE GAS METER.    ON JANUARY 9, 2018, MTNGUD PERSONNEL CONDUCTED AN ODORANT TEST NEAR THE INCIDENT SITE.  THE ODORANT WAS IN AN ACCEPTABLE RANGE.      ON JANUARY 11, 2018, AN AIR TEST ON THE SERVICE LINE INDICATED A FAILURE OF THE SERVICE LINE.  EXCAVATION UNDER A CONCRETE SLAB LED TO DISCOVERY OF A SERVICE LINE REPAIR BY USE OF A COMPRESSION COUPLING.  THIS REPAIR LOCATION WAS DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH A FOUR-INCH PVC DRAIN PIPE.  ONE END OF THE SERVICE LINE WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE COUPLING.  IT IS UNKNOWN IF THIS DISCONNECTION OCCURRED BEFORE OR DURING THE EXPLOSION.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED TWO (2) ADDITIONAL DAMAGED AREAS ON THE SERVICE LINE.  IN 2006, AN EXCAVATOR HIT AND CUT THE LINE.  THIS DAMAGE HAD BEEN REPAIRED BY USE OF A STAB FITTING.  THIS REPAIR WAS INTACT.  THE SIGHT OF A CROSSING OF THE SERVICE LINE WITH A CABLE TV LINE REVEALED THAT THE SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN STRUCK AND PULLED WITH FORCE LEAVING MARKS AND DISTORTION ON THE LINE.  THE LINE REMAINED SERVICEABLE AT THIS DAMAGE LOCATION.  AN MTNGUD SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS ONSITE AT THIS METER ON 12/5/17 FOR A REGULAR ANNUAL PRESSURE CONFIRMATION AND THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF IRREGULARITIES OR ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS AT THAT TIME.    WEATHER IN CROSSVILLE, TENNESSEE, PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT WAS UNUSUALLY COLD WITH FREEZING AND THAWING OF THE GROUND IN THE VICINITY, WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COUPLING TO SERVICE LINE FAILURE.  PREVIOUS EXCAVATION DAMAGE MAY ALSO HAVE COMPROMISED THE INTEGRITY OF THIS CONNECTION.  THE SEPARATION OF THE COUPLING FROM THE SERVICE LINE WAS SO COMPLETE, IT RAISES ISSUES OF THE TIME AND CAUSE OF THE SEPARATION."

THE OTHER FOUR RESIDENTS SUSTAINED NON-LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.    AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, ATMOS PERSONNEL WERE IN THE AREA WORKING TO REPAIR A NON-HAZARDOUS LEAK IN THE 3500 BLOCK OF ESPANOLA. AN ATMOS OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR HEARD THE EXPLOSION AND TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PROTECT LIVES AND MAKE THE AREA SAFE.  HE DIRECTED HIS CREW TO START EVACUATING A TWO-BLOCK AREA, NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ACCIDENT HOUSE.  FIREFIGHTERS AND ATMOS CREWS WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR ADVISING RESIDENTS TO EVACUATE AND TO REFRAIN FROM STARTING CARS OR SWITCHING ON LIGHTS.  THE EVACUATION WAS COMPLETED IN 12-15 MINUTES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF DALLAS FIRE-RESCUE.

ATMOS ENERGY, THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION (RRC), PIPELINE & HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (PHMSA), AND DALLAS FIRE - RESCUE ASSISTED WITH THE NTSB'S INVESTIGATION.       THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AT 3534 ESPANOLA DRIVE WAS THE IGNITION OF AN ACCUMULATION OF NATURAL GAS THAT LEAKED FROM THE GAS MAIN THAT WAS DAMAGED DURING A SEWER REPLACEMENT PROJECT 23 YEARS EARLIER.  POST-ACCIDENT EXCAVATION CONFIRMED THE 2"" MAIN WAS CRACKED IN THE AREA IT HAD BEEN GOUGED, BENT, AND DENTED BY MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT.  THE THIRD-PARTY DAMAGE WAS NEVER REPORTED TO ATMOS."

COLUMBIA'S SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED AT 12:42 AM AND ARRIVED ON SITE AT 01:15 AM AND FOUND THAT GAS HAD BEEN SHUT OFF AT THE METER VALVE BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. ADDITIONAL COLUMBIA RESOURCES ARRIVED ON SITE AT 1:50 AM TO ASSIST IN THE RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT. COLUMBIA EMPLOYEES SET UP A PERIMETER AND EVACUATED THE NEIGHBORING HOME AT 605 FLEMING FALLS WHERE NATURAL GAS READINGS WERE DISCOVERED IN THE BASEMENT. COLUMBIA VERIFIED THAT THE SYSTEM PRESSURE WAS WITHIN THE MAOP ESTABLISHED FOR THAT SYSTEM AND THAT ODORANT WAS COMPLIANT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. ELECTRIC METERS WERE REMOVED TO ELIMINATE SOURCES OF IGNITION AND COLUMBIA BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR LEAKAGE AND ENSURE SAFETY.    THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RAIN  THAT CAUSED THE SANITARY LIFT PUMPS TO FAIL  AND MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY PUSHED A SLUG OF SEWER GAS  INTO THE BASEMENT VIA FLOOR DRAINS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE TIED DIRECTLY TO THE SANITARY SEWER FOR 605 AND 613 FLEMING FALLS RD. THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED APPEARS TO BE A LOW LEVEL EXPLOSION. COLUMBIA LOCATED AND REPAIRED A TOTAL OF FOUR LEAKS OF WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE NON-CAUSAL. THE CLOSEST BEING APPROXIMATELY 290' AWAY AND THE FURTHEST BEING APPROXIMATELY 1300' AWAY FROM THE INCIDENT. THE SURFACE LEVEL OF THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET IS APPROXIMATELY 12'  LOWER THAN THE SURFACE LEVEL OF THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE INCIDENT SITE.  COLUMBIA CREATED A TEMPORARY BYPASS TO KEEP CUSTOMERS IN SERVICE, ABANDONING APPROXIMATELY 775' OF BARE STEEL HIGH PRESSURE MAINLINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET.    COLUMBIA PRESSURE TESTED THE BARE STEEL MAIN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET ALONG WITH THE SERVICES (WITH NO DROP IN PRESSURE AT 76 PSIG) AND RAN A CAMERA INSIDE THEM TO ENSURE ALL SERVICE TEES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND TO LOOK FOR ANOMALIES. COLUMBIA TESTED APPROXIMATELY 448' OF HIGH DENSITY POLY ETHYLENE (HDPE) MAIN LINE AND 6 SERVICES ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND IT SUCCESSFULLY PASSED SEVERAL PRESSURE TESTS AT 76 PSIG (OPERATING PRESSURE), 15 INCHES WATER COLUMN AND 150 PSIG. IN ADDITION COLUMBIA TESTED APPROXIMATELY 1,175' OF HDPE MAIN LINE AND SERVICE ON THE STREET BEHIND INCIDENT SITE. AT 613 FLEMING FALLS RD., COLUMBIA PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE AND CHECKED THE SERVICE REGULATOR FOR LOCK UP AND FLOW WITHOUT ISSUE AND NO LEAKAGE DETECTED. THE SERVICE LINE AT THE NEIGHBORING HOME (637  FLEMING FALLS RD) WAS ALSO TESTED AND FOUND TO BE LEAK FREE. COLUMBIA DID EXPLORATORY EXCAVATION AROUND THE AREA TO ENSURE CONDUITS DID NOT EXIST THAT COULD CONVEY MIGRATING GAS. COLUMBIA ALSO RAN A CAMERA IN THE SANITARY MAIN AND SEWER LATERALS TO ENSURE THAT A CROSS BORE DID NOT EXIST. UN-COLLAPSED STORM SEWERS WERE VIDEOED AS WELL TO ENSURE A CROSS BORE DID NOT EXIST.     COLUMBIA WORKED WITH THE PUCO, STATE FIRE MARSHALL, A THIRD-PARTY CAUSE AND ORIGIN SPECIALIST, AND A GEOLOGIST TO DETERMINE A CAUSE. LABORATORY GAS ANALYSES AND OUR GEOLOGIST'S INTERPRETATION INDICATE THAT THE STRAY GAS SAMPLES HAD A COMPARABLE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION AND MOLECULAR PROFILE, AND IS SIMILAR IN ORIGIN TO COLUMBIA'S PIPELINE GAS, HOWEVER, NATURALLY OCCURRING METHANE CONTAINING SIMILAR MOLECULAR AND ISOTOPIC PROFILE CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE. THE GEOLOGIST THEORIZES THAT GROUND WATER, IN COMBINATION WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF RAIN WATER, LIKELY CREATED CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR GAS MIGRATION TOWARD THE STRUCTURES AT 605 AND 613 FLEMING FALLS RD.     COLUMBIA HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT CANNOT BE FULLY ASCERTAINED. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS REPORT A FINAL REPORT.    NOTE: UPDATED LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE 9-21-18"

AT 20:25 NV ENERGY (NVE) WAS CONTACTED BY THE CITY OF RENO PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCH NOTIFYING OF A ""WORKING FIRE"" AT 624 EUREKA AVENUE IN RENO, NEVADA.  NVE GAS DISPATCH SENDS GAS SERVICEMEN TO INVESTIGATE.  AT 20:51 THE CITY OF RENO PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCH CONTACTED NVE AGAIN TO REPORT THAT THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION AT THIS LOCATION, POSSIBLY FROM THE FURNACE.      AT 21:02 THE FIRST NVE PERSONNEL ARRIVE AT THE SITE AND FOUND THE HOME AT 624 EUREKA AVE DAMAGED BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GAS EXPLOSION WITH INDICATIONS OF UNDERGROUND GAS READINGS.  RENO FIRE DEPARTMENT AND NVE PERSONNEL EVACUATE THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND MONITOR GAS CONCENTRATIONS WHILE OTHER NVE PERSONNEL EXPOSE THE SERVICE TEE AND SECURE THE GAS LEAK.      THE LEAK OCCURRED AT THE THREADED JOINT BETWEEN A 3/4"" BLACK IRON PIPE NIPPLE AND A 3/4"" BLACK IRON 90 DEGREE ELBOW AT THE SERVICE TEE CONNECTION TO 614 EUREKA AVENUE.  BASED UPON THE RENO FIRE DEPARTMENT INCIDENT REPORT, NATURAL GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE TEE APPEARS TO HAVE TRAVELED THROUGH A SERVICE TRENCH INTO THE BASEMENT OF 624 EUREKA.  THE LEAKING GAS WAS IGNITED IN THE BASEMENT BY THE FURNACE, EXPLODED, AND DAMAGED THE HOME.  TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE IN THE RESIDENCE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION BUT NO INJURIES WERE SUSTAINED.  THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE CAUSE IS DETERMINED.     AT 22:36 THE NVE DUTY SUPERVISOR ON SCENE DETERMINED THAT THE PROPERTY DAMAGE COSTS WOULD EXCEED $50,000.  THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS MADE AT 22:49 AND WAS GIVEN NRC INCIDENT REPORT # 1207485.  NVE PROVIDED AN UPDATE TO THE NRC ON MARCH 23, 2018 AT 15:44 AND WAS GIVEN NRC INCIDENT REPORT # 1207546.    SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE:  FURTHER ANALYSIS HAS DETERMINED THAT THE PIPE-TO-ELBOW JOINT FAILED DUE TO OVERLOAD FROM AN EXTERNAL BENDING LOAD AND NOT DUE TO A MATERIAL OR MANUFACTURING DEFECT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PIPES OR FITTINGS.  THE EXTERNAL BENDING LOAD AT THE FAILED PIPE-TO-ELBOW JOINT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF LOADING IMPARTED TO THIS JOINT DURING COMPACTION AROUND THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION.  NV ENERGY'S CONTRACTOR WAS PERFORMING BACKFILL AND COMPACTION ACTIVITIES ON THIS TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION ONE DAY PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT OCCURRING.       FINAL UPDATE:  ANALYSIS HAS CONCLUDED AND THE INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY A LEAK FROM A CRACK IN THE BLACK IRON PIPE USED FOR THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION FOR THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY 614 EUREKA AVENUE. THE GAS MIGRATED INTO THE BASEMENT OF THE INCIDENT HOUSE WHERE IT FOUND AN IGNITION SOURCE, MOST LIKELY THE HOUSE FURNACE. THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE CRACK IN THE PIPE WAS MECHANICAL OVERLOADING OF THE HORIZONTAL SECTION OF THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION.  THE MECHANICAL OVERLOADING WAS LIKELY CAUSED DURING COMPACTION OF SAND AROUND THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION, DUE TO INSUFFICIENT COVER (SAND ABOVE THE PIPE) DURING COMPACTION."

AT 7:06PM, THE WE ENERGIES EMPLOYEE ON SITE NOTIFIED GAS DISPATCH OF THE EXPLOSION AND REQUESTED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE.      AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION, SEVEN LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND ONE WE ENERGIES EMPLOYEE WERE INJURED.  TWO FIRE FIGHTERS AND A WE ENERGIES EMPLOYEE WERE TRANSPORTED TO A NEARBY HOSPITAL.  WE ENERGIES WAS LATER INFORMED THAT ONE OF THE FIREFIGHTERS WHO WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL HAD PASSED AWAY.  THE OTHER FIREFIGHTER TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL REQUIRED INPATIENT, OVERNIGHT HOSPITALIZATION AND THE WE ENERGIES EMPLOYEE TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL DID NOT REQUIRE INPATIENT, OVERNIGHT HOSPITALIZATION (UPDATED 1/2/19).

BECAUSE THIS WAS BELIEVED TO BE A SECONDARY IGNITION EVENT, IT WAS NOT REPORTED TO THE NRC BECAUSE THE DAMAGE TO THE OPERATORS FACILITIES DID NOT EXCEED $50,000.   THE OPERATOR RECEIVED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON AUGUST 8, 2018 FROM THE NEBRASKA STATE FIRE MARSHAL THAT INDICATED THAT IGNITION AT THE METER SET LIKELY OCCURRED CONCURRENTLY WITH THE FIRE THAT OCCURRED INSIDE OF THE HOUSE AS A RESULT OF THE LIGHTNING STRIKE.  BASED ON THAT INFORMATION, THE OPERATOR PROMPTLY REPORTED THE INCIDENT AT 11:07 AM THAT DAY.  THE 48-HOUR FOLLOW-UP REPORT WAS SUBMITTED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM ON AUGUST 10, 2018 (NRC #1221114).    ON OCTOBER 24, 2018 THE GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE RESIDENCE.

THERE APPEARED TO BE EXTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE 1"" COUPLING AND THE 1"" CTS PIPING APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN LOWERED IN PLACE BY THE HOME BUILDER.    THE 1"" CTS PIPING WAS A DEAD END SERVICE STUB AND WAS UNKNOWINGLY OPERATING AT 230 PSI DUE TO A PREVIOUS UPRATE OF A 10"" STEEL PIPELINE.    THE 1"" CTS, SDR 11.5, ALDYL-A PIPE AND 1"" SOCKET FUSION COUPLING WERE SUBJECT TO A SHOCKWAVE CREATED BY THE HOME EXPLOSION.    THE 1"" CTS, SDR 11.5, ALDYL-A PIPE AND 1"" SOCKET FUSION COUPLING IS BEING SENT TO AN INDEPENDENT LAB FOR A FORENSIC INVESTIGATION AND TESTING.    4/12/2019:  LAB TESTING RESULTS WERE RECEIVED FROM TWO THIRD PARTY CONSULTANTS.  RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE 1"" COUPLING FAILED DUE TO SLOW CRACK GROWTH PROPAGATION AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE STRESSES BEING APPLIED TO THE FITTING.  PER THE REPORTS, THE CRACK GROWTH AND LEAK POINT ON THE COUPLING WAS CONSISTENT WITH A TENSILE LOAD ON THE COUPLING.  THE PHENOMENA OF A BRITTLE CRACK WHICH STARTS IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE HEAT FUSION JOINED TUBING TERMINATES ON THE INTERIOR OF A SOCKET FUSION HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED PREVIOUSLY IN INDUSTRY.  THE CRACK FORMED BY THE NOTCH GEOMETRY CREATED BY THE INSERTED TUBING AND ITS POINT OF HEAT FUSION JOINING TO THE SOCKET WHICH, WHEN UNDER GAS PRESSURE, CAN CREATE A STRESS RISER.  THE NOTCH GEOMETRY MAY HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTED BY THE SOCKET FUSION TOOLS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION.  THE FAILURE IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE OF ALDYL-A PIPE AND FITTINGS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO 1984 AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INNER WALL CRACKING.  THE COUPLING WAS 10"" UNDER THE FOUNDATION OF THE GARAGE AND APPEARED TO BE LOWERED IN PLACE DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STRUCTURE.  LOWERING WOULD HAVE CAUSED TENSILE STRESS ON THE PIPE AND COUPLING.  NO EXTERNAL DAMAGES WERE SEEN ON THE PIPE OR COUPLING FROM CONSTRUCTION OF THE GARAGE STRUCTURE.  AGAIN PER THE REPORTS, THE INTERNAL PRESSURE IN THE PIPE MAY HAVE ACCELERATED THE FAILURE IN THE COUPLING BUT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AS THE SOLE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE.  THE TIME TO FAILURE FROM CRACKING COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED OR DETERMINED IN EITHER REPORT.    11/19/2019 - SUBMITTED AS FINAL REPORT WITHOUT FURTHER CHANGES AT THIS TIME."

THIS IS THE DATE WHEN CONFIRMED DISCOVERY WAS MADE THAT THE LOSS OF NATURAL GAS EXCEEDED 3 MILLION CUBIC FEET.       THE 48 HOUR UPDATE WAS MADE ON DECEMBER 13, 2018.  TWO ADDITIONS WERE GIVEN IN THE 48 HOUR UPDATE:  THE AMOUNT OF GAS LOST WAS INCORRECTLY REPORTED - CORRECT AMOUNT WAS 5,853 MCF (5,853,000 CUBIC FEET).  THE OTHER UPDATE WAS TO INCLUDE THE CONTRACTOR INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT - M.K. WEEDEN.  THE NRC REPORT NUMBER FOR THIS UPDATE IS INCIDENT REPORT # 1232850.    NO INJURIES, DEATHS, OR EVACUATIONS OCCURRED WITH THIS INCIDENT.  NO LOCATE TICKET WAS SUBMITTED BY THE EXCAVATING PARTY WHEN THIS WORK WAS BEING DONE.      16:26 MST M.K. WEEDEN HIT A 12-INCH STEEL GAS MAIN LOCATED NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF FARRELL AND TEXAS AVE. WITH AN EXCAVATOR.  THE LINE WAS AN INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE LINE OPERATING AT 50 PSIG.    16:45 MST NORTHWESTERN WAS NOTIFIED BY THE CONTRACTOR THAT A NWE GAS LINE WAS HIT NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF FARRELL AND TEXAS AVE.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE WAS NOTIFIED AND NORTHWESTERN ENERGY PERSONNEL WAS DISPATCH TO EVALUATE THE HIT LINE FROM A SAFE DISTANCE.  ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE CONTACTED TO ASSIST WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES AND TRAFFIC CONTROL.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL WAS ALSO ONSITE TO ASSIST.    17:00 MST  NORTHWESTERN ENERGY WITH OTHER PERSONNEL CREATED A 360 DEGREE ZONE AROUND THE LOCATION OF THE HIT LINE AND WAS MONITORING THE GAS LEVELS TO CREATE A SAFE ZONE.  CONTINUOUS AIR MONITORING WAS DONE UNTIL THE FLOW OF GAS WAS SHUT DOWN.        17:10 MST  DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE LINE, NORTHWESTERN ENERGY NEEDED FURTHER ASSISTANCE BY OUR GAS TRANSMISSION DEPARTMENT WITH EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS TO MAKE THE REPAIR.    17:30 MST  MORE NWE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AND FURTHER EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED TO FINALIZE THE SAFEST AND BEST WAY TO CORRECT THE SITUATION.      03:45 MST  THE FLOW OF GAS WAS SHUT DOWN BY INSERTING STOPPER.  WITH FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE PIPE ONCE SAFE, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DAMAGE BY THE EXCAVATOR BUCKET CREATED TWO PUNCTURES HOLES IN THE PIPE. ONE OF THE PUNCTURES WAS MEASURED AT 3 INCHES BY 2 INCHES.  THE SECOND MEASURED AT 4 INCHES BY 3 INCHES.      8:15 MST  REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 8TH AND PIPE LINE WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE."

PROVIDED OPERATOR QUALIFICATION AND PROCEDURE INFORMATION TO NCUC ON 2/22/2019 VIA EMAIL.    ORIGINAL PROJECT PLAN  ON 1/7/19, A PSNC ENERGY CONTRACTOR WAS RETIRING A 350 PSIG 4 IN. LATERAL (M-320) OFF ON OUR 8 IN. TRANSMISSION LINE (T-04) IN ASHEVILLE.  THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF THE WORK WAS NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF SWANNANOA RIVER AND FAIRVIEW ROADS.  THIS WORK WAS THE FINAL STEP TO RETIRING A BRIDGE ATTACHMENT ON FAIRVIEW ROAD.  THIS PROJECT INCLUDED REROUTING SOME SECTIONS AND DE-RATING PART OF THE 350 PSIG SYSTEM TO A STANDARD DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PRESSURE OF 60 PSIG.  THIS SECTION OF M-320 USED TO FEED SOME REGULATOR STATIONS THAT ARE NOW RETIRED.   THE ORIGINAL PROJECT PLAN WAS TO EXCAVATE AND RETIRE THE 4 IN. LATERAL SECTION USING A 4 IN. TD WILLIAMSON (TDW) STOP-OFF FITTING AND REPAVE THIS AREA BY 11 PM THAT NIGHT.        SUMMARY OF WHAT HAPPENED  WHEN THE PIPE WAS EXPOSED AT ABOUT 11:00 AM IT WAS DISCOVERED THE PIPE WAS 6 IN. SO 6 IN. FITTINGS OF IDENTICAL PRESSURE SPECIFICATIONS WERE ROUNDED UP. A TDW THREAD-O-RING (TOR WHICH IS BASICALLY A 2IN.  FITTING USED IN THE TAPPING OPERATION) AND THE 6 IN. STOP-OFF FITTING WERE WELDED ON THE PIPE.  THE TOR WAS TAPPED AT ABOUT 6 PM BY OUR TAPPING CONTRACTOR, WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE 6 IN. PIPE WAS ACTUALLY CASING PIPE OVER THE 4 IN. PIPE.  THE PILOT BIT PENETRATED THE 4 IN. LINE CREATING A 3/8 IN. HOLE THAT SENT GAS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS DOWN THE CASING. THE TAPPING CONTRACTOR TECHNICIAN AND THE PIPELINE CONTRACTOR SUPPORT PERSONNEL EVACUATED THE HOLE. PSNC ENERGY HAD AN INSPECTOR ON SITE AND ADDITIONAL PSNC ENERGY PERSONNEL WERE BROUGHT IN TO MONITOR BOTH ENDS OF THE CASINGS FOR GAS MIGRATION. GASEOUS ATMOSPHERE WAS ABOUT 25-30 FT.  RADIUS FROM THE BELL HOLE CONTAINING THE TOR. THE PROJECT DESIGN SPECIFIED THE REMAINING LATERAL STUB TO BE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE SO THERE WAS NO ROOM TO INSTALL ANOTHER STOP-OFF FITTING. THIS MADE THE REPAIR/SHUT-OFF PLAN MORE COMPLEX. THE SECTION OF TRANSMISSION LINE CONTAINING THE LATERAL CONNECTION WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ISOLATED TO STOP THE LEAK. THIS IS A SINGLE FEED SYSTEM SO A BYPASS WAS REQUIRED. PSNC ENERGY WAS ABLE TO ROUND UP TWO TDW 3-WAY TEES (WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO FACILITATE BOTH STOP-OFF AND BYPASS) FROM ANOTHER JOB. TRANSMISSION CONTRACT CREWS WERE BROUGHT IN TO WELD ON THE FITTINGS AND TO WELD UP AND INSTALL A 120 FT. 8 IN. BYPASS. TWO REMOTE BELL HOLES WERE DUG TO INSTALL THE FITTINGS ON T-04. THE SHUTDOWN PROCESS OF INSTALLING FITTINGS AND BYPASS, TESTING AND PURGING THE BYPASS, STOPPING OFF THE DAMAGED SECTION, AND TRANSFERRING THE FLOW TO THE BYPASS LASTED FROM APPROXIMATELY 8:00 PM ON 1/7/19 UNTIL 11:10 AM ON 1/8/19. REPLACING THE DAMAGED LATERAL CONTAINING THE SECTION OF T-04 WITH PRE-TESTED PIPE AND PLACING THE PIPELINE BACK IN SERVICE TOOK UNTIL 11:10 AM ON 1/8/19. BACKFILLING AND ROAD REPAIR LASTED THROUGH THE EVENING.          OTHER INFORMATION OF NOTE  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND REPAIR PROCESSES REQUIRED THE SHUT-DOWN OF SWANNANOA RIVER ROADS.  THE ENTIRE STOPPAGE OF THE LEAK AND REPAIR WERE WORKED OUTSIDE OF THE HAZARDOUS GASEOUS ENVIRONMENT.  PSNC WORKED WITH LOCAL NEWS TO PUT OUT TRAFFIC ADVISORIES.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE AREA DETERMINED GAS READS (APPROXIMATELY 55% GAS) IN THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 73 FEET WEST OF THE SEWER LEAD SERVING 406 IRWIN AVE.  GAS READS WERE ALSO OBTAINED AT 398 IRWIN AVE. RESULTING IN AN EVACUATION OF THE OCCUPANT AT THIS PROPERTY. (FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION, THE SEWER LEAD FOR 406 IRWIN AVENUE WAS LATER DETERMINED TO BE SOUTH OF THE SANITARY SEWER LOCATED AT THE INTERSECTION OF GOING STREET AND IRWIN AVENUE)    THE DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED ON FEBRUARY 3, 2019 AT APPROXIMATELY 00:35 HOURS.  THE SOURCE OF THE BLOWING GAS WAS DETERMINED TO BE A LEAK ON THE 3/4 INCH PIPE THREAD THAT TIED INTO THE HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE SERVICE LINE, REGULATOR AND SECURITY WERE REPLACED AND GAS READS BEGAN TO DISSIPATE FROM THE SANITARY SEWER.    ON FEBRUARY 20, 2019 THE INTERESTED PARTIES MET ON-SCENE TO CONDUCT A JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION.  THE PARTIES AGREED THE CURRENT WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROPERTY MADE IT UNSAFE TO PROCEED FORWARD WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  THE JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION WAS POSTPONED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 DAYS.    UNTIL A FULL ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION CAN BE COMPLETED THE CAUSE AND ORIGIN REMAINS CLASSIFIED AS UNDETERMINED.      ON MARCH 25, 2019 A JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED, THE LOCATION WAS CAREFULLY EXCAVATED AND ALL GAS APPLIANCES WERE REMOVED AND TRANSPORTED TO THE SAFETY ENGINEERING LABORATORIES, INC. (SEL) FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATION AND TESTING.    THE FOLLOWING DAY, MARCH 26, 2019 DESTRUCTIVE TESTING FOR THE FAILURE THAT OCCURRED ON THE BURIED REGULATOR LOCATED AT 443 SOUTH BOULEVARD WAS PERFORMED AT THE CONSUMERS ENERGY TRAIL STREET LABORATORY.      ON APRIL 10, 2019 A JOINT SCENE EXAM WAS HELD WITH CONSUMERS ENERGY, SEL AND THE MPSC.  THE BASEMENT OF THE RESIDENCE WAS EXCAVATED AND WATER DRAINED IN THE ATTEMPT TO LOCATE, TRACE AND VIDEO (PHOTOGRAPH) THE SEWER LINE FROM THE INSIDE OF THE HOME TO THE SANITARY SEWER UNDER THE ROADWAY.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION, A HOLE (APPROXIMATELY 4X4) CUT INTO THE TOP OF THE METAL SEWER LINE IN THE BASEMENT BEFORE THE SEWER TRAP WAS DISCOVERED.  THE SEWER LINE ALSO RAN INTO A REPAIRED SINKHOLE AREA ON GOINGS INSTEAD OF IRWIN AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED BY THE CITY OF PONTIAC WATER DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE FROM AN EARLIER INVESTIGATION.    FOLLOWING A SERIES ON INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS THE IGNITION OF NATURAL GAS.  THE IGNITION SOURCE REMAINS UNDETERMINED.  ADDITIONALLY, THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED DUE TO THE LACK OF COOPERATION BY THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE PROPERTY'S RESIDENT."

THE TECHNICIANS CONFIRMED THAT AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED AT A PRIVATE RESIDENCE RESULTING IN BURN INJURIES TO A RESIDENT.  GAS METER TO THE HOME WAS SHUT OFF. A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR WAS USED INSIDE THE HOME, DETECTING A PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS.  THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED OUTSIDE WITH THE PRESENCE OF GAS BEING FOUND IN SOIL.  DURING THIS INVESTIGATION A LEAK WAS DETECTED ON A MECHANICAL NUT FOLLOWER COUPLING ON THE 2IN STEEL MAIN WHICH WAS SECURED AT 04:48 3/21/2019.  FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATION PROVED NO INDICATION OF LEAKS ON THE JURISDICTIONAL SERVICE LINE.  ADDITIONALLY, TESTING OF CUSTOMER OWNED FACILITIES PROVIDED NO INDICATION OF MATERIAL LEAKS.   THE MAIN HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN 1962.  NO INDICATIONS OF A LEAK WERE FOUND IN THE PRIOR TWO LEAK SURVEYS, CONDUCTED IN 2014 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.   IN THE ABSENCE OF ANOTHER IDENTIFIABLE SOURCE, THE LEAKING MECHANICAL FITTING ON THE MAIN MAY HAVE BEEN A SOURCE OF FUEL FOR THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED.  HOWEVER, AN IDENTIFIED PATH OF MIGRATION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED FOR THE SOURCE OF FUEL TO ENTER THE HOME.    EXTREME WINTER TEMPERATURE AND FROST CONDITIONS AT THE MECHANICAL FITTING MAY HAVE AFFECTED SOIL CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE FITTING ALONG WITH POTENTIAL FOR ABNORMAL CONTRACTION/EXPANSION OF THE FITTING AND PIPE COMPONENTS.

OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S THREE-PERSON CREW STRUCK AND DAMAGED THE SERVICE LINE FEEDING THE STRUCTURE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET AT APPROXIMATELY 9:06AM. OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S CREW DID NOT CALL 911 BUT NOTIFIED NC-811, THE STATE'S ONE-CALL OFFICE, OF THE DAMAGE AT APPROXIMATELY 9:31AM.  NC-811 AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED A DAMAGE TICKET, WHICH WAS DELIVERED TO PSNC AT APPROXIMATELY 9:35AM.  AN ORDER WAS AUTOMATICALLY DISPATCHED TO PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER AT APPROXIMATELY 9:36AM. THE FIRST RESPONDER REVIEWED THE TICKET AT APPROXIMATELY 9:43AM AND BEGAN HEADING TO THE SITE. PSNC RECEIVED A CALL FROM 911 AT APPROXIMATELY 9:48AM, NOTING THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ALREADY ON THE SCENE. PSNC'S DISPATCH CONTACTED THE FIRST RESPONDER EN ROUTE TO ADVISE HIM OF A GAS ODOR AND A DAMAGED LINE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ISSUED A COMBINATION OF EVACUATION AND SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS AT APPROXIMATELY 9:58AM. PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:03AM.  BETWEEN HIS ARRIVAL AND APPROXIMATELY 10:06AM, PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER AS WELL AS PSNC'S DISPATCH CONTACTED ADDITIONAL PSNC RESOURCES TO ASSIST WITH SECURING AND MAKING THE GAS LEAK SAFE. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:06AM, THE STRUCTURE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET EXPLODED. BETWEEN 10:26AM AND 10:50AM, ADDITIONAL PSNC EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING A CONSTRUCTION CREW, ARRIVED AT THE SITE. CREWS CONVENED AT THE INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER TO EVALUATE OPTIONS TO SHUT OFF THE GAS FLOW. BY 11:05AM, THE CREWS IDENTIFIED THE PROPER VALVE, SECURED THE NECESSARY TOOLS, AND, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:10AM, SHUT OFF GAS FLOW TO THE IMPACTED AREA BY CLOSING A VALVE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY THREE BLOCKS FROM THE SCENE.      THE EXPLOSION ALSO SEVERELY INJURED A MEMBER OF OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S CREW, THE OWNER/OPERATOR OF PS SPLICING LLC (WHICH HIRED OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY TO PERFORM THE HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING WORK), PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER, AND A FIREFIGHTER. AN ESTIMATED 25 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION AND TAKEN TO LOCAL AREA HOSPITALS, AND 5 INDIVIDUALS WERE REPORTEDLY ADMITTED. PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER DIED IN THE HOSPITAL ON APRIL 25, 2019 AS A RESULT OF INJURIES THAT HE SUSTAINED IN THE EXPLOSION. THE EXPLOSION KILLED THE OCCUPANT OF THE STRUCTURE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET. THE EXPLOSION RESULTED IN THE STRUCTURES AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET AND 111 NORTH DUKE STREET BEING CONDEMNED BY THE DURHAM FIRE DEPARTMENT. BOTH STRUCTURES HAVE SINCE BEEN DEMOLISHED. APPROXIMATELY 21 BUILDINGS IN TOTAL WERE REPORTEDLY DAMAGED BY THE EXPLOSION.      PSNC'S INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT THE SERVICE LINE TO THE STRUCTURE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET WAS STRUCK AND DAMAGED DURING OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING WORK.  APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR LATER, AND ONLY 3 MINUTES AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SCENE, THE ESCAPING GAS FROM THE DAMAGED SERVICE LINE IGNITED AND RESULTED IN THE EXPLOSION.

A SUBSEQUENT PRESSURE TEST OF THE SERVICE LINE DID NOT HOLD PRESSURE.    INITIAL EXCAVATION OF THE FACILITIES DETERMINED CAUSE OF LEAKAGE TO BE A LEAKING SOCKET FUSION ON A TRANSITION FITTING THAT TRANSITIONED THE 1/2-INCH PE SERVICE PIPE TO THE 3/4-INCH STEEL SERVICE RISER.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED A CRACK IN THE BODY OF THE 1/2-INCH PE SERVICE PIPE TO BE THE CAUSE OF LEAKAGE.  THE ORIGINAL REPORT FOR THIS INCIDENT DOCUMENTED THE APPARENT CAUSE IN PART G AS ""G8 - OTHER INCIDENT CAUSE"" AS THE CAUSE OF THE LEAKING SOCKET FUSION AT THE TIME WAS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.  AS THE ABOVE NOTED CRACK WAS FOUND, THE APPARENT CAUSE IN PART G HAS BEEN CHANGED TO ""G5 - PIPE, WELD, OR JOINT FAILURE"" - BODY OF PIPE - CRACK.

DEO CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRE WAS OCCURRING ON ITS FACILITIES AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45 AM BASED ON COMMUNICATIONS WITH FIELD OPERATIONS AND GAS CONTROL. THE LINE WAS ISOLATED AND FIRE EXTINGUISHED AT 3:30AM. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR STRUCTURE DAMAGES. THE 30 INCH STEEL MAIN HAD BEEN RECENTLY INSTALLED, AND THE LOCATION OF THE RELEASE WAS AT A ROAD CROSSING AUGURED UNDER THE ROAD INSTALLED AT APPROXIMATELY 14.5FT. DEEP ON THE SOUTH END TO APPROXIMATELY 21FT. DEEP ON THE NORTH END. ON 11-24-19 THE FAILED SECTION WAS REMOVED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE RELEASE OF GAS HAD OCCURRED AT A GIRTH WELD FAILURE. IN COOPERATION WITH THE PUCO, THE FAILED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE (ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL SECTIONS IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE SECTION CONTAINING ADDITIONAL WELDS FOR TESTING) WERE EXTRACTED AND RETAINED BY DNV FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE PROTOCOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS WERE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY DEO AND THE PUCO. DNV ISSUED ITS FINAL METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT ON 5-18-20, AND DEO HAS CONCLUDED ITS REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT.  ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT INDICATES THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF AXIAL BENDING STRESSES ON THE PIPE STRING, LIKELY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A CAVERN OR VOID IN THE ROCK FORMATION THROUGH WHICH THE AUGER PASSED, WHICH CAUSED THE AUGER TO VEER OFF COURSE. THE BENDING STRESS CAUSED THE FIELD GIRTH WELD LOCATED AT THE EDGE OF THE CAVERN TO FAIL, PRIMARILY IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO DETERMINED THAT A PRE-EXISTING HYDROGEN CRACK (FORMED PRIOR TO THE FINAL FAILURE) AND WELDING DEFICIENCIES CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED STRESS STATE ON THE GIRTH WELD."

SCUD EMPLOYEES RECEIVED THE PAGE AND CONFIRMED THAT THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDING. BOB TRENTHAM WAS THE FIRST SCUD EMPLOYEE ON THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 9:25 PM. UPON ARRIVAL, THE SEVIERVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT (SFD) AND SEVIERVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT (SPD) ALONG WITH SURROUNDING FIRE DEPARTMENTS WERE ON THE SCENE AND PERFORMING FIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS ON THE CABIN AND TRUCK THAT WERE BOTH ON FIRE. ADDITIONAL SCUD EMPLOYEES BEGAN ARRIVING SHORTLY AFTER BOB AND WE STARTED COORDINATION TO TURN THE GAS OFF. SPD SECURED THE SCENE AND WERE ONLY ALLOWING EMERGENCY PERSONNEL PAST A CHECKPOINT ~0.2 MILES FROM THE SCENE. SCUD GIS MAPS WERE REVIEWED TO ASSESS THE LOCATION OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE TO CABIN 4020, ALONG WITH THE GAS MAINS AND VALVES IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE METER. SCUD EMPLOYEES OPERATED COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS (CGI'S) TO MONITOR THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS IN THE AIR AROUND THIS LOCATION.      THE SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS IS A 2'PE MAIN WITH A ONE-WAY SUPPLY OPERATING AT 45 PSIG. SCUD VALVE #71L 17 (LOCATED ~250' UPSTREAM OF THE CABIN) WAS OPERATED AT ~9:45 PM TO TURN THE GAS OFF. THE DOWNSTREAM SCUD VALVE #71L 6 (LOCATED ~1,550' DOWNSTREAM OF THE CABIN) WAS ALSO OPERATED TO LIMIT THE LOSS OF GAS AND IN HOPES OF MAINTAINING PRESSURE FOR THE 88 CUSTOMERS DOWNSTREAM OF VALVE #71L 17. THE 3/4' PE GAS SERVICE LINE TO 604 WALNUT WAY WAS EXPOSED BY HAND-DIGGING AND THE LINE WAS SQUEEZED OFF. THIS SERVICE LINE WAS INSTALLED ON 2-19-1993, SO THERE WAS NO EXCESS FLOW VALVE. THE 'LINEPACK' VOLUME OF GAS STORED IN THE PIPELINE DOWNSTREAM OF VALVE #71L 6 WAS CONSUMED BY THE DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS AND THE MAIN LINE WENT FLAT BEFORE THE GAS SERVICE ON THE MAIN COULD BE RESTORED. AT 11:20 PM, THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS REPORTED THAT THE FIRE IS CONTAINED. GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED ON THE 2'PE MAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30 PM. THE TEMPERATURE WAS 35F AND CUSTOMERS NEEDED HEAT FOR THE NIGHT. ADDITIONAL SCUD PERSONNEL WAS CALLED IN TO ASSIST WITH THE RESTORATION OF SERVICE AND LIGHT-UPS OF THE GAS APPLIANCES. NATURAL GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO ALL OF THE 88 AFFECTED HOMES (EXCEPT TWO UNOCCUPIED CABINS) WHEN SCUD EMPLOYEES LEFT THE SCENE EARLY SUNDAY MORNING.    JAMES GREENE CALLED TENNESSEE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION'S (TPUC) GAS PIPELINE SAFETY DIVISION (GPSD) DEPUTY DIRECTOR TRAVIS ASLINGER TO NOTIFY HIM OF THE INCIDENT AT 10:47 PM ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16. AFTER THAT CONVERSATION, JAMES CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AT 10:55 PM TO FILE AN INITIAL REPORT FOR THE INCIDENT (REPORT #1264126). ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, JAMES CALLED THE NRC PROVIDE A 48-HOUR UPDATE (REPORT #1264233).     ACCORDING TO THE SPD INCIDENT REPORT, CASE NUMBER 2019037915, 'OFFICERS WERE DISPATCHED TO 604 WALNUT WAY REGARDING A CABIN FIRE THAT WAS STARTED BY A VEHICLE CRASH. UPON ARRIVAL, THE CABIN WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. A WHITE PICKUP TRUCK HAD ROLLED BACKWARDS DOWN THE HILL OFF OF THE ROAD AND SMASHED INTO THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, BREAKING THE GAS LINE AND CAUSING AN EXPLOSION.' THERE WERE FOUR FEMALE OCCUPANTS IN THE CABIN THAT WERE ABLE TO EVACUATE THE CABIN. WHEN SPD ARRIVED, THE MAN ADMITTED HE WAS THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK AND HE HAD BEEN HEAVILY DRINKING. HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PLACED UNDER ARREST FOR DUI AND IMPLIED CONSENT AND TRANSPORTED TO JAIL.    SCUD HAD 18 EMPLOYEES ON THE SCENE AT SOME POINT SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. ON SUNDAY, SCUD EMPLOYEES WENT BACK TO THE SCENE TO ASSESS THE SITUATION DURING DAYLIGHT. THEY OBSERVED THE BURNT TRUCK WHERE IT CRASHED INTO THE HOUSE AND KNOCKED A HOLE IN THE CRAWLSPACE. THE TRUCK STRUCK THE GAS METER (WHICH WAS UNDER THE BACKSIDE OF THE TRUCK), BROKE THE TOP PART OF THE RISER OFF, AND BENT THE BOTTOM PART OF THE BROKEN RISER INTO THE CRAWLSPACE OF THE CABIN."

A LOCAL SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED IMMEDIATELY UPON NOTIFICATION.  UPON ARRIVAL THE SERVICE TECH MADE THE AREA SAFE AND STARTED TO ASSESS THE SCENE.  IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED AT A PRIVATE RESIDENCE AND TWO OCCUPANTS WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.      VERBAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE BILLINGS FIRE DEPARTMENT INDICATED TWO OCCUPANTS WERE TAKEN TO THE BILLINGS HOSPITAL AND THEN FLOWN TO A HOSPITAL IN DENVER.      A LEAK INVESTIGATION OUTSIDE THE RESIDENCE WAS COMPLETED, GAS WAS INDICATED AT THE RISER OF THE RESIDENCE WITH HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF GAS AT THE INTERSECTION OF TWO 1982 VINTAGE 1 1/4"" PLASTIC MAINS ACROSS THE ALLEY.  THE MAINS FEEDING THE TEE WERE ISOLATED, SECURING THE LEAK AT 05:50 ON NOVEMBER 18, 2019.  THE MAIN WAS EXCAVATED AND A CRACK WAS DISCOVERED AT THE INTERFACE OF THE PIPE AT A SOCKET TEE CONNECTING THE MAINS.      FACTORS THAT CAUSED THE GAS TO BE CONTROLLED AT 5:50 WERE THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A LEAK INVESTIGATION TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE SURROUNDING STRUCTURES, PINPOINT THE SUSPECTED SOURCE OF THE GAS, GET EMERGENCY LOCATES COMPLETED, EXCAVATE THE LOCATION OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF GAS TO ENSURE THE LOCATION OF LEAK, AND EXCAVATE TWO LOCATIONS FOR SHUT OFF OF THE GAS DUE TO THE AREA BEING SERVED FROM TWO LOCATIONS.       UPON EXCAVATION, THE PIPE AT THE TEE LOCATION, HAD A DEFLECTION FROM THE MAIN LINE WHICH WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD INSTALLATION OF THE PIPE.  THIS DEFLECTION MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED FROM IMPROPER SUPPORT DURING THIRD PARTY EXCAVATION OR IMPROPER BACKFILL METHODS POST THIRD PARTY EXCAVATION THAT OCCURRED SOMETIME AFTER MONTANA-DAKOTA'S INITIAL INSTALLATION OF THE PIPE.  FURTHER INDICATION THAT OUTSIDE FORCES CAUSED THE CRACK INCLUDE BACKFILL MATERIAL SURROUNDING THE PIPE AND TEE THAT APPEARED TO BE FOREIGN FROM NATIVE MATERIALS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED AT TIME OF INITIAL INSTALLATION.    4/8/2021 - THE PE PIPE MATERIAL WAS REVISED TO CORRECT FROM PE 2406 TO PE 2306.      4/19/2021 - THE NUMBERS FOR GAS RELEASED (PG. 1 ITEMS 7) AND GAS CONSUMED (PG. 2 ITEM 21C) ARE NOT KNOWN.  PHMSA FORM F 7100.1 REQUIRES A NUMERICAL ENTRY EVEN THOUGH AN ESTIMATED VALUE IS UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED.       5/3/2021 - ADDED THE PIPE MANUFACTURER AND UPDATED NRC REPORT NUMBERS.  VOLUME OF GAS UNINTENTIONALLY RELEASED CALCULATED USING AND ESTIMATED OPENING OF 0.05 SQUARE INCHES AND A PRESSURE OF 55 PSIG.  FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING AND ILLUSTRATIVE CALCULATION OF GAS LOSS, AN ESTIMATED TIME OF 3 MONTHS WAS UTILIZED."

AN ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION WITH THE MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (MPSC) WAS SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 2, 2019.    ON DECEMBER 2, 2019 DURING AN INCIDENT INVESTIGATION WITH THE MPSC, GAS READS WERE DISCOVERED ALONG THE 2"" STEEL MEDIUM PRESSURE MAIN.

CONSUMERS ENERGY FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT 20912 LEFEVER WAS THE RESULT OF A RELEASE AND/OR MIGRATION OF CONSUMERS ENERGY'S REGULATED GAS PIPELINE OR GAS FACILITIES.    THE SOURCE OF THE NATURAL GAS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE SEVERAL POTENTIAL SOURCES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE INVESTIGATION, THE UNCAPPED NATURAL GAS VALVE, THE GAS DRYER AND THE CORROSION LEAK DISCOVERED ON THE PIPELINE SERVING THE RESIDENCE. HOWEVER, OF THE THREE POTENTIAL SOURCES IDENTIFIED, THE LEAST PLAUSIBLE SOURCE OF NATURAL GAS WAS THE CORROSION LEAK FOUND ON THE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOUND DURING THE INVESTIGATION TO INDICATE THAT GAS MIGRATED FROM THE PIPELINE TO THE STRUCTURE."

PGW IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED FIRST RESPONDERS TO INVESTIGATE. THE FIRST PGW EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 11:49 AM. UPON ARRIVAL THREE PROPERTIES WERE ON FIRE (1433, 1435, & 1437 S. 8TH STREET) AND THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS CONSISTENT WITH A POTENTIAL EXPLOSION. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE PFD, PGW  PERFORMED HOUSE CHECKS AND THE PFD EVACUATED APPROXIMATELY 60 PEOPLE DURING THE EVENT.     A 6"" CAST IRON GAS MAIN SUPPLIED THE GAS SERVICES TO THE PROPERTIES ON FIRE. IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN THE GAS MAIN AND SERVICES TO THESE PROPERTIES PGW UTILIZED GREASE INJECTED THROUGH THE SERVICES OF 1421 AND 1441 S. 8TH STREET. THE MAIN AND SERVICES WERE SHUT DOWN AT 13:27. THE PERMANENT CUT AND CAPS OF THE 6"" CAST IRON MAIN WERE COMPLETED AT 17:30.     ON 12/19/19 AT 23:00 PGW INSERTED A CAMERA INSIDE THE ABANDONED 6"" CAST IRON GAS MAIN AND IDENTIFIED A POTENTIAL BROKEN MAIN LOCATION. THE CAMERA VIEW WAS HINDERED DUE TO THE MAIN BEING FILLED WITH WATER. ON 12/21/19 (AFTER THE WATER HAD BEEN DRAINED FROM THE MAIN) PGW INSERTED THE CAMERA AGAIN AND IDENTIFIED A CLEAR CIRCUMFERENTIAL BREAK WHERE THE MAIN HAD DROPPED. THE LOCATION OF THE BROKEN MAIN WAS 136 FEET NNCL OF DICKINSON STREET.     ON 12/22/19 PGW WAS GIVEN ACCESS TO EXCAVATE AND RETRIEVE THE 6"" CAST IRON BROKEN MAIN FOR EVIDENCE. THE FOOTWAY AND ROADWAY PAVEMENT WAS UNDERMINED AT THIS LOCATION AND A LARGE CAVITY EXISTED IN THE INTERSECTION OF 1400 S. 8TH STREET AND 800 WILDER STREET.  A 6"" STAINLESS STEEL SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED ON THE BROKEN MAIN AND THIS SECTION OF MAIN WAS MARKED AND REMOVED FOR EVIDENCE.     THE TESTING AND METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED DUE TO THE CURRENT WORK STOPPAGE CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE TESTING WILL BE RESCHEDULED AFTER THE PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED.     THE TESTING AND METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE ON 6/24/2020 AT AFFILIATED ENGINEERING LABORATORIES, INC. 777 NEW DURHAM ROAD, EDISON NJ 08817.     ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 THE TESTING ANALYSIS WAS PROVIDED TO PGW AND THE PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION. THE SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS CONCLUDED EXTERNAL STRESSES APPLIED TO A GRAPHITIZED GAS MAIN INDUCED A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK WHEREBY GAS WAS ALLOWED TO ESCAPE. THERE  WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A PRE-EXISTING BREACH OR LEAK LOCATION OBSERVED ON THE FRACTURE SURFACE."

AT 12:30 PM, THE RELIGHT COSTS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE GREATER THAN $50,000, AND A TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 12:51 PM.  GAS SERVICE WAS INTERRUPTED TO 270 COMMERCIAL AND 4067 RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.  THE APPROPRIATE REPAIRS WERE MADE AND THE FACILITY WAS RESTARTED AT 12:12 AM ON MARCH 6, 2020.

A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS DISPATCHED AND ARRIVED ON-SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 23:16 HOURS. DUE TO EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND FLOODING IN THE AREA, CE PERSONNEL WAS STAGED THROUGHOUT THE AREA TO ASSESS NATURAL GAS FACILITIES AND RESPOND TO GAS EMERGENCIES.     AN INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED A 4"" STEEL MP PIPELINE DAMAGED. THE PIPELINE WAS SEVERED WHEN SIGNIFICANT FLOODING IN THE AREA CAUSED A ROAD WASH-OUT. A MUELLER FITTING WAS INSTALLED TO CONTAIN THE BLOWING GAS.  BECAUSE THE PIPELINE WAS A ONE FEED, A LOSS OF SERVICE TO APPROXIMATELY 360 CUSTOMERS OCCURRED.    A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO UTILIZE COMPRESSES NATURAL GAS (CNG) TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY SERVICE TO THE MAJORITY OF THE IMPACTED CUSTOMERS UNTIL A PERMANENT PLAN COULD BE COORDINATED WITH THE GLADWIN AND MIDLAND COUNTY ROADWAY COMMISSIONS.    ON JUNE 16, 2020 SERVICE WAS REINSTATED TO THE MAJORITY OF IMPACTED CUSTOMERS BY COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 6.25 MILES OF NEW GAS DISTRIBUTION MAIN. ADDITIONAL MAIN INSTALLATION IS NEEDED TO REINSTATE THE REMAINING CUSTOMERS (APPROXIMATELY EIGHT CUSTOMER REMAINING).  THE ANTICIPATED COMPLETION DATE IS JULY, 15, 2020.

AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM, ON JUNE 13, 2020, DOMINION ENERGY NORTH CAROLINA CREWS RECEIVED A 911-CALL REPORTING AN EXPLOSION AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE RESIDENCE IN RALEIGH, NC. 911 REPORTED TO DENC THAT AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE CRAWL SPACE OF THE HOME AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE. DENC CREWS DID NOT OBSERVE ANY FIRE AT THE HOUSE. A CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR THE HOMEOWNER OF 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE WAS REPORTEDLY INJURED AT THE SCENE WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED. AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, THE CONTRACTOR WAS IN THE CRAWL SPACE UNDERNEATH THE HOME PERFORMING WORK ON THE HOMEOWNER'S HVAC SYSTEM. THE CONTRACTOR WAS REPORTEDLY BURNED BY THE EXPLOSION AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE LOCAL BURN HOSPITAL.  THE FOUR NEIGHBORING HOMES, ALONG WITH 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE, WERE ALL EVACUATED (I.E., 1345, 1347, 1349, 1401, 1403 COURTLAND DRIVE). THE RESIDENTS OF 1401 AND 1403 COURTLAND DRIVE WERE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES WITHIN DAYS OF THE INCIDENT. AS OF AUGUST 2020, ALL RESIDENTS OF 1345 AND 1349 COURTLAND DRIVE HAD RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES. THE HOME AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE SUSTAINED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND IS NOT HABITABLE.    WHILE THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN AND CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS ONGOING, A NATURAL GAS LEAK WAS OBSERVED NEAR THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE STEEL TAPPING TEE AND THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE THAT SERVED 1345 COURTLAND DRIVE.  THE RESPONDING DENC CREW STOPPED THE LEAK BY RUNNING THE TAPPING TEE CUTTER DOWN.  AS A PRECAUTION, THE TAPPING TEE AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE WAS ALSO SHUT OFF BY RUNNING DOWN THE TAPPING TEE PERFORATOR/STOP FOR THE SERVICE LINE.  BOTH SERVICES WERE LATER DISCONNECTED, AND STEEL CAPS WERE WELDED ON.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE MAIN IN FRONT OF 1345, 1347 AND 1349 COURTLAND DRIVE WAS EXPOSED AND VERIFIED THERE WERE NO LEAKS.      A PORTION OF THE STEEL TAPPING TEE AND PLASTIC SERVICE LINE TO 1345 COURTLAND DRIVE WITH THE VERIFIED LEAK WAS REMOVED AND PRESERVED FOR FURTHER TESTING. A LEAK FLOW TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE SUBJECT PIPE IN A LABORATORY SETTING ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020, USING COMPRESSED AIR. AT 59.0 PSI, THE LEAK RATE WAS 72 SCFH OF AIR. THIS CONVERTS TO APPROXIMATELY 97.3 SCFH OF NATURAL GAS. USING THIS LEAK RATE, DENC CAN MORE ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF LOST GAS AT 322.26 MCF, AS NOTED IN PART A.7. THE LOST GAS COST ESTIMATE CAN ALSO BE UPDATED TO $1,495, AS NOTED IN PART D.2F.    DENC RETAINED INVESTIGATORS WHO EXAMINED THE SCENE.  THESE INVESTIGATORS OBSERVED OXY-ACETYLENE TANKS LAYING ON THEIR SIDE IN THE CRAWL SPACE OF 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE INVESTIGATORS ASSESSED BLAST DYNAMICS AND OBSERVED ISOLATED BURN DAMAGE. SPECIFICALLY, THEY FOUND LITTLE TO NO FLAME PROPAGATION. THE PHOTOGRAPHS AFTER THE EXPLOSION DEMONSTRATE THAT NEITHER THE WOOD JOISTS IN THE CRAWL SPACE NOR THE FOAM INSULATION WERE BURNED. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST IGNITION OF A DISCRETE AMOUNT OF GASEOUS FUEL. HOWEVER, THE EXACT AMOUNT OF GAS THAT WAS CONSUMED IN THE EXPLOSION IS NOT YET DETERMINED. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF GAS CONSUMED IN THE EXPLOSION IS LESS THAN 1 MCF. (NOTE: REPORT PART A.21C WILL ONLY ALLOW A MINIMUM OF 1 MCF TO BE ENTERED.)    IN LIGHT OF THE PHYSICAL FINDINGS, INVESTIGATORS QUESTIONED WHETHER OTHER POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS MAY HAVE LED TO THIS EXPLOSION. SPECIFICALLY, THE OXY-ACETYLENE TANKS, WHICH WERE LOCATED IN THE CRAWL SPACE WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS FIRST ARRIVED ON SCENE AND APPARENTLY IN USE BY THE HOMEOWNER'S HVAC CONTRACTOR AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT, BUT LATER WENT MISSING AS OF AUGUST 8, 2020, AND HAVE NOT BEEN RECOVERED AS OF THE SUBMISSION DATE OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.    THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT REMAINS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, AND THE INVESTIGATION REMAINS ONGOING.

THE GAS FIRST RESPONSE (GFR) TECHNICIAN FIRST ARRIVED ONSITE AT 02:40 AND FOUND THAT A CONTRACTOR (SEFNCO) HAD DAMAGED THE 4"" PE GAS MAIN WHILE DIRECTIONAL DRILLING ACROSS MERIDIAN STREET TO INSTALL NEW TELECOMMUNICATION CABLE.     THE GFR TECHNICIAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND REQUESTED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD BLOCKED ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY ONE BLOCK RADIUS SURROUNDING THE DAMAGE. PSE'S ELECTRIC FIRST RESPONSE WAS CONTACTED TO DE-ENERGIZE CUSTOMERS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY AS A PRECAUTION.   IN ORDER TO ISOLATE AND SHUT DOWN THE GAS LEAK, A COMBINATION OF PIPE SQUEEZES AND VALVE CLOSURES WERE REQUIRED.  THE BREAK WAS JUST SOUTH OF A TWO-WAY CONNECTION TO A 2"" PE MAIN THAT RUNS PERPENDICULAR (EAST/WEST) TO THE 4"" PE MAIN.  VALVES ON THE 2"" MAIN, IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE DAMAGED 4"" MAIN, WERE NOTED BY GAS FIRST RESPONSE PERSONNEL AS REQUIRING EXCAVATION TO OPERATE.  BECAUSE OF THE GAS READS IN THE AREA, SQUEEZE LOCATIONS ON THE 2"" MAIN FURTHER FROM THE DAMAGED 4"" WERE SELECTED AS ALTERNATES TO EXCAVATING AND OPERATING THE VALVES.  SQUEEZING OF THE 4"" PE MAIN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE DAMAGE WAS NOT FEASIBLE AS THE DEPTH OF MAIN WAS DETERMINED TO BE 6 TO 7 FEET DEEP.  INSTEAD, MULTIPLE VALVE CLOSURES WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE ISOLATION PLAN. IN THE COURSE OF OPERATING ONE OF THE SELECTED VALVES, THE VALVE ADAPTER BROKE AND SO AN ADDITIONAL SQUEEZE NORTH OF THE VALVE WAS MADE. SHUT DOWN OF THE 4"" PE MAIN WAS ACHIEVED AT 11:10.  A TOTAL OF 47 CUSTOMER OUTAGES WERE IDENTIFIED. THE FINAL REPAIR WAS COMPLETED ON JULY 1, 2020 AT APPROXIMATELY 02:00; THE SYSTEM WAS RE-PRESSURIZED AND THE CUSTOMER RELIGHTS BEGAN.     THE CONTRACTOR HAD REQUESTED LOCATES; IT WAS DISCOVERED DURING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE THAT THE LOCATE MARKS DID NOT COVER THE FULL SCOPE OF THE LOCATE TICKET AND WERE NON-EXISTENT IN THE AREA OF THE DAMAGED MAIN.    THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO NRC DUE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE EXCEEDING $50,000.

GRAND RIVER AVENUE, BETWEEN HILTON AND CHALLIS BRIGHTON, MICHIGAN (LIVINGSTON COUNTY).    A GAS SERVICE WORKER (GSW) ARRIVED ONSITE AT 09:01 HOURS AND BEGAN A LEAK INVESTIGATION. DURING THE  INVESTIGATION, MULTIPLE UNDERGROUND READS WERE DISCOVERED AS WELL AS READS IN NEARBY MANHOLES. THE GSW REQUESTED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES, GAS SERVICE AND GAS DISTRIBUTION, TO ASSIST WITH LEAK PROSPECTING AND TO CHECK NEARBY STRUCTURES TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY.     THE GAS DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED ONSITE AT 10:40 HOURS AND BEGAN VENTING TRAFFIC SIGNAL MANHOLES WHERE GAS READS WERE DISCOVERED AND PROCEEDED WITH LEAK PROSPECTING TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE GAS RELEASE.  TRAFFIC CONTROL WAS SET UP AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS (POLICE AND FIRE) WERE ONSITE TO ASSIST WITH TRAFFIC CONTROL. THERE WERE NO FATALITIES OR INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.    THE DISTRIBUTION CREW CONTINUED EXPOSING A 6"" STEEL HIGH-PRESSURE PIPELINE AND LEAK PINPOINTING THROUGH THE NIGHT DISCOVERING A FROST BALL ON THE PIPELINE NEAR 8580 W. GRAND RIVER AVENUE.     GAS OPERATIONS ISOLATED THE HIGH-PRESSURE PIPELINE FROM THE VALVE CLUSTER AT HOWELL RS 402 (HILTON ROAD) BY CLOSING DESIGNATED VALVE H140 AND ENSURING H138 WAS OPEN.  THIS RESULTED IN A LOSS OF SERVICE TO 13 CUSTOMERS. THE GAS MECHANICS PROCEEDED TO CLOSED IN BOTH HP STATIONS TO ISOLATE THE LINE. THE VALVE STOPPAGE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND REQUIRED THE INSTALLATION OF CONTROL FITTINGS TO OBTAIN A COMPLETE SHUT-DOWN.      THE PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED, CUT AND CAPPED ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2020 AT APPROXIMATELY 21:30  THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS DETERMINE TO BE A 4"" HP BOLTED FLANGE FITTING OFF OF A MUELLER HP BOTTOM-OUT FITTING. THE FLANGE GASKET FAILED CAUSING GAS TO BE RELEASED.    ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2020, APPROXIMATELY 390'-2"" PLASTIC MEDIUM-PRESSURE PIPELINE WAS INSTALLED AND SERVICE RESTORE TO THE 13 CUSTOMERS PREVIOUSLY SERVED BY THE HP PIPELINE.    THE ISOLATED SEGMENT OF THE HIGH-PRESSURE PIPELINE HAS BEEN SCHEDULE FOR REPLACED AT A LATER DATE.

ATMOS ENERGY CREWS RESPONDED BY MAKING THE AREA SAFE, EVACUATING THE HIGH SCHOOL, AND THEN BEGAN THE PROCESS OF RESTORING SERVICE TO THE HIGH SCHOOL.  THE MAIN LINE IN THE AREA CONSISTED OF 4"" STEEL PIPE.  HOWEVER, THE REPAIR REQUIRED THE INSTALLATION OF A POLY TRANSITION FITTING FROM THE STEEL MAIN TO THE 3"" STEEL SERVICE LINE AS WELL AS THE INSTALLATION OF A POLY VALVE.  A BELL HOLE WAS DUG AT THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE AND WHERE THE MAIN TO SERVICE LINE CONNECTION WAS BEING REPLACED. ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, REPAIRS HAD BEEN COMPLETED ON THE SEGMENT OF MAIN UP TO THE CLOSED POLY VALVE AND WAS ACTIVE WITH NATURAL GAS. ATMOS ENERGY EMPLOYEES WERE PREPARING TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE SERVICE LINE WHEN NATURAL GAS SUDDENLY ESCAPED AND IGNITED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:20 A.M.  TWO EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED AND WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.  ONE EMPLOYEE WAS TREATED AND RELEASED, AND THE OTHER WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL AT 11:17 AM.      THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE AND RELEASE OF THE 4"" ELECTROFUSION COUPLING THAT OCCURRED WITHIN THE NORTH BELL HOLE.  THE JOINT FAILURE WAS SUDDEN AND OCCURRED AFTER THE COUPLING WAS  INSTALLED AND PLACED IN SERVICE.  THE JOINT FAILURE AND SEPARATION OF THE COUPLING OCCURRED WITHIN THE SAME EXCAVATED BELL HOLE THAT THE RESULTING INJURED CREW MEMBERS WERE WORKING DOWNSTREAM PERFORMING FINAL SYSTEM TIE-INS.      THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF IGNITION OCCURRED FROM THE ENERGIZED FITTING BEING FUSED (4"" EF COUPLING) ON THE OUTLET SIDE OF THE VALVE. NONE OF THESE ACTIVITIES PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF A DIRECT CAUSE OF FAILURE.

A GRADE 2 LEAK WAS DISCOVERED ON A SERVICE LINE DURING THE LEAK INVESTIGATION. THE CORROSION LEAK WAS EXCAVATED AND REPAIRED ON FEBRUARY 11, 2021. MDU RESPONDED TO ANOTHER OUTSIDE GAS ODOR REPORTED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON FEBRUARY 23, 2021. MDU FOUND A CORROSION LEAK. THE EXTENT OF THE CORROSION DID NOT ALLOW FOR A PERMANENT REPAIR. A TEMPORARY LEAK CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND THE EXCAVATION WAS LEFT OPEN TO AVOID MIGRATION.     BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE CORROSION FOUND ON FEBRUARY 23, 2021, MDU CORROSION CONTROL PERSONNEL STARTED INVESTIGATING THE CONDITION OF THE HINSDALE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ON MARCH 1, 2021. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION THAT CONCLUDED ON MARCH 3, 2021, AN EXPANDED INVESTIGATION WAS STARTED ON MARCH 9, 2021. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND INVESTIGATION, MDU CONDUCTED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE HINSDALE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ON MARCH 17 AND 18, 2021. THE LEAK SURVEY IDENTIFIED APPROXIMATELY 40 UNDERGROUND LEAKS OF WHICH 12 WERE GRADE 1. AS GRADE 1 LEAKS WERE IDENTIFIED, MDU CREWS WERE ON SITE TO ESTABLISH SAFETY PERIMETERS, EXCAVATE, AND MAKE TEMPORARY REPAIRS.     ON MARCH 19, 2021 AT 5:20 P.M. MST, MDU MADE THE DECISION TO SHUT IN AND REPLACE THE STEEL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, WHICH WOULD EXCEED $50,000, AT WHICH TIME MDU NOTIFIED THE NRC.     MDU HIRED A 3RD PARTY INVESTIGATOR TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE CORROSION. THE INVESTIGATOR WAS ON SITE 3/30/2021 AND 4/13/2021. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN MDU RECEIVES THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE 3RD PARTY INVESTIGATIONS.

THE INCIDENT SEVERELY DAMAGED THE STRUCTURE AT 3645 E.57TH ST, WHICH WAS RAZED ON THE EVENING OF 8-3-21 BY CITY OF CLEVELAND CONTRACTORS.  TWO NEIGHBORING STRUCTURES (3643 AND 3649 E.57TH ST) ALSO SUSTAINED DAMAGES.    ON 8-3-21, AT APPROX. 2:00 PM, DOMINION ENERGY OHIO (DEO) RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CITY OF CLEVELAND FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTING THE INCIDENT.  DEO FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED AT APPROX. 2:12 PM AND STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS TO 3645 E.57TH BY CLOSING THE SERVICE LINE CURB VALVE AT APPROX. 2:35 PM.  DEO ALSO SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF GAS TO NEIGHBORING STRUCTURES (3643 AND 3649 E.57TH) BY CLOSING THE SERVICE LINE CURB VALVES.    DEO BAR-HOLED ALONG THE MAINS ON BOTH SIDES OF E.57TH AND ALONG THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINES AT 3633, 3639, 3642, 3643, 3644, 3645, 3646, 3649, 3653, AND 3659 E.57TH, AND 0% READINGS WERE FOUND.

DEO PERFORMED ODORANT TESTING AT 3653 E.57TH, AND THE ODORANT WAS READILY DETECTIBLE AT 0.48%.    ON 8-3-21, THE GAS METER, MANIFOLD, AND A SECTION OF SERVICE LINE PIPING WERE REMOVED FROM THE BASEMENT AT 3645 E.57TH.  DEO PRESSURE TESTED THE REMAINING SERVICE LINE PIPING AT 3645 E.57TH AT 7 OZ (OPERATING PRESSURE) FOR 10 MIN.  A PRESSURE DROP OF APPROX. 0.5 OZ WAS OBSERVED, BUT NO LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.  A SECTION CONTAINING THE CURB VALVE AND MAIN-TO-CURB TRANSITION WAS REMOVED, AND THE REMAINING SERVICE LINE WAS RE-TESTED AT 7 OZ FOR 10 MIN.  A PRESSURE DROP OF APPROX. 0.5 OZ WAS OBSERVED.  CITY CONTRACTORS RAZED THE STRUCTURE AT 3645 E.57TH THAT EVENING.      ON 8-4-21, DEO EXCAVATED, EXPOSED, AND RE-TESTED THE REMAINING SERVICE LINE (APPROX. 24 FT) AT 7 OZ FOR 10 MIN.   A PRESSURE DROP OF APPROX. 1 OZ WAS OBSERVED, BUT NO IDENTIFIABLE LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.  A CUT WAS MADE APPROX. 8 FT FROM THE END OF THE SERVICE LINE (CLOSEST TO THE MAIN), AND THE 8-FT SECTION WAS RE-TESTED AT 7 OZ FOR 10 MIN.  A PRESSURE DROP OF SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 2 OZ WAS OBSERVED, BUT NO IDENTIFIABLE LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.  THE REMAINING 16-FT SECTION WAS RE-TESTED AT 7 OZ FOR 10 MIN, AND NO PRESSURE DROP WAS OBSERVED.    THE GAS METER, MANIFOLD, AND SERVICE LINE SECTIONS WERE PRESERVED FOR LABORATORY INSPECTION AND TESTING.  THREE APPLIANCES (FURNACE, WATER HEATER, AND STOVE/RANGE) AND MISCELLANEOUS HOUSE LINE PIPING ALSO WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE CITY'S POST-DEMOLITION DEBRIS REMOVAL ON 8-5-21 AND 8-6-21.  THESE ARTIFACTS WERE EXAMINED ON 9-17-21.  THE 8-FT SECTION OF SERVICE LINE THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS TESTED ON 8-4-21 WAS FLOW RATE LEAK TESTED AT 7 OZ, AND NO MEASURABLE FLOW RATE WAS OBSERVED.  THE SERVICE LINE SECTION FROM THE BASEMENT OF 3645 E.57TH WAS KINKED APPROX. 45 DEGREES BY THE CITY'S CONTRACTORS DURING ITS REMOVAL ON 8-3-21, AND A THROUGH-WALL CRACK WAS OBSERVED AT THE KINK.    THE KINKED SERVICE LINE SECTION WAS EXAMINED ON 12-17-21, WHICH INCLUDED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCANNING.  EVIDENCE OF EXTERNAL CORROSION AND THINNING OF THE PIPING WALL WAS OBSERVED IN THE AREA WHERE THE SERVICE LINE PASSED THROUGH THE FOUNDATION INTO THE BASEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED IT TO BE LESS RESISTANT TO BENDING FORCES.  THE CRACK AT THE KINK WAS VISUALLY EXAMINED, REVEALING THAT THE PIPING WALL WAS COLLAPSED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE SERVICE LINE.    FOR REPORTING PURPOSES, DEO CLASSIFIES THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT AS EXTERNAL CORROSION FAILURE (SEE PART G1), BUT THE ROOT CAUSE REMAINS UNKNOWN AND UNDETERMINED.

THE PE PIPE OPERATED AT A PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATELY 55 PSIG WITH AN MAOP OF 60 PSIG, WAS AT A DEPTH OF 36 INCHES, AND LOCATE MARKS WERE PRESENT AND ACCURATE.  AVISTA WAS NOTIFIED AT 10:13 A.M. PDT AND WAS ON SITE AT 10:20 A.M. PDT.  THE NORTHERN LAKES FIRE DISTRICT RESPONDED AND EVACUATED 3 NEARBY RESIDENCES AT 6971, 6997 AND 7025 W CHRISTINE STREET.  THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE REQUIRED SQUEEZING THE 2"" MAIN IN THREE LOCATIONS AS IT WAS CLOSE TO A TEE.  THE SQUEEZES WERE COMPLETE AT 11:43 A.M. PDT TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF GAS.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT LEFT ONCE THE SCENE WAS SECURE.  UNDERGROUND BARHOLE READINGS WERE TAKEN IN FRONT OF THE THREE EVACUATED HOUSES AND SHOWED 0 PERCENT LEL.  INSIDE GAS READINGS WERE TAKEN AT 6997 W CHRISTINE STREET AT APPROXIMATELY 12:10 P.M. PDT AND SHOWED READINGS BETWEEN 10% AND 70% LEL.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN EXITED THE HOUSE AND LEFT THE DOORS OPEN TO AIR OUT THE HOUSE.    AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30 P.M. PDT THE HOMEOWNERS AT 7025 W CHRISTINE STREET CAME HOME AND REQUESTED TO ENTER THEIR HOUSE.  A GAS SERVICEMAN CHECKED EACH ROOM OF THE HOUSE WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR AND FOUND READINGS OF 0% LEL, SO THE GAS SERVICEMAN CLEARED THE HOUSE FOR THE HOMEOWNERS TO REENTER.    SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE HOMEOWNERS AT 6997 W CHRISTINE STREET REQUESTED TO GET BACK INTO THEIR HOUSE.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN CHECKED EACH ROOM WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR, WHICH NOW READ 0% LEL AND HE ALLOWED THE HOMEOWNERS BACK IN THEIR HOUSE.  AT THIS TIME, THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY WERE STILL SHUT OFF TO THE HOUSE AND THE ELECTRIC METER HAD TO BE RE-INSTALLED.  AFTER TURNING THE ELECTRICITY BACK ON THE HOMEOWNER REPORTED POPPING NOISES COMING FROM THE FURNACE.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN CHECKED NEAR THE FURNACE AND FOUND 0% LEL AND DECIDED TO TURN THE FURNACE OFF AT THE THERMOSTAT.  WHILE ENTERING THE HOUSE FROM THE GARAGE, THE GAS SERVICEMAN SAW A RED GLOW ABOVE HIS HEAD WHICH WAS AN IGNITION OF GAS AT APPROXIMATELY 12:46 P.M. PDT.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN EXITED THROUGH THE OPEN GARAGE DOOR AND THE MALE HOMEOWNER EXITED THROUGH THE REAR GARAGE ACCESS DOOR.   INDIVIDUALS ON SCENE THEN HELPED TO GET THE FEMALE HOMEOWNER OUT OF THE UPSTAIRS OF THE HOUSE THROUGH A WINDOW.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE BUILDING WAS CONSUMED BY FLAMES.  OPERATOR PERSONNEL ON SCENE CALLED 911 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE GAS IGNITED AND THE NORTHERN LAKES FIRE DISTRICT WAS ON SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 12:57 P.M. PDT.  THE FEMALE HOMEOWNER WAS ASSESSED BY EMTS ON SITE AND THE MALE HOMEOWNER WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO BE TREATED FOR SECOND DEGREE BURNS ON HIS FOREARM BUT WAS NOT ADMITTED.    PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS A POCKET OF GAS INSIDE THE HOUSE IN A LOCATION THAT COULD NOT BE DETECTED BY THE GAS SERVICEMAN'S INSTRUMENT. IT WAS THAT POCKET OF GAS THAT IGNITED CAUSING THE FIRE.  THE BUILDING WAS DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS WITH A VALUE EXCEEDING $122,000 RESULTING IN THIS INCIDENT BEING REPORTABLE.  AVISTA DENIES LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES AND INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT."

THE VEHICLE'S IMPACT CAUSED THE PIPING TO SEPARATE, LEADING TO AN UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF GAS FROM THE INLET AND OUTLET SIDES OF TGS'S REGULATOR STATION. AFTER DAMAGING THE ATMOS ENERGY METERING STATION, THE VEHICLE CAME TO REST ON TOP OF THE ATMOS ENERGY PIPING. ATMOS ENERGY'S MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTATION WAS DAMAGED AND COULD NOT PROVIDE A VOLUME OF GAS THAT FLOWED THROUGH THE STATION DURING AND AFTER THE INCIDENT. TGS HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE DAMAGE ESTIMATES FOR ATMOS FACILITIES OR THE VEHICLE AT FAULT FOR THE INCIDENT."
