DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A SCHEDULED PIPELINE SHUTDOWN.  AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT PHMSA ISSUED A CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER THAT ORDERED THE PIPELINE TO REMAIN SHUT DOWN UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN THE CAO WERE SATISFIED.  ENBRIDGE SATISFIED ALL CONDITIONS OF THE CAO AND RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM PHMSA TO RESUME OPERATIONS ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 AT WHICH TIME ENBRIDGE SUCCESSFULLY RESTARTED THE LINE.      OF FURTHER NOTE, WHILE THE TELEPHONIC REPORT TO THE NRC IS STATED AS 13:33 ON JULY 26, 2010, ENBRIDGE MADE A CALL TO NRC AND WAS ON HOLD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  ENBRIDGE THEN HUNG UP THE CALL AND CALLED AGAIN AT WHICH TIME IT WAS ON HOLD FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF TIME.  THE STATED 13:33 REFLECTS THE TIME THAT ENBRIDGE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE VERBAL NOTIFICATION OF THE INCIDENT.    THE RELEASE WAS INITIALLY ESTIMATED AT 19,500 BARRELS OF WHICH AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT ENTERED THE TALMADGE CREEK AND ULTIMATELY THE KALAMAZOO RIVER.  THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED PRODUCT RELEASED IN OR REACHING WATER HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED AND IS BASED UPON A CALCULATION PROVIDED BY AN EXTERNAL CONSULTANT.  THE AMOUNT OF OIL THAT REACHED WATER IS SUBJECT TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  ENBRIDGE IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES TO CALCULATE THIS VOLUME, AND WILL COMMUNICATE THE METHODOLOGY AND SUBSEQUENT VOLUME TO PHMSA UPON COMPLETION.     THE SECTION THAT FAILED HAS BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF NTSB. PENDING THE RESULTS OF METALLURGICAL TESTING AND FAILURE INVESTIGATIONS, ENBRIDGE IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE COMPLETE AND FINAL DATA FOR THIS ORIGINAL REPORT SUBMISSION. INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT IS TO BE CONSIDERED ESTIMATED UNTIL SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORTS ARE FILED. NTSB, PHMSA AND ENBRIDGE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS ACCIDENT HAVE COMMENCED. AS THIS INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING, THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CAUSE(S) HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED.    TO DATE, ENBRIDGE HAS NOT FOUND ANY POTABLE WATER SOURCES (PUBLIC OR PRIVATE) WITH DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION THAT HAS BEEN VERIFIABLY LINKED TO THE ENBRIDGE RELEASE. THE ASSESSMENT OF ALL DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THE AFFECTED AREA IS ONGOING. ENBRIDGE IS IN THE PROCESS OF SAMPLING DRINKING WATER SOURCES AND IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IN EVALUATING DRINKING WATER FROM POTABLE WELLS TO ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH.    ENBRIDGE ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $300 MILLION AND $400 MILLION. THESE CHARGES INCLUDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND CLEANUP ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRUDE OIL RELEASE, COSTS TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE AND RELATED INSPECTION COSTS, POTENTIAL CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, AND LOST REVENUE. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO ACCURATELY PROJECT THE TOTAL COST OF THE LEAK AND ITS REMEDIATION, HOWEVER WE ARE UNABLE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE SPECIFIC DETAIL REQUESTED IN THIS FORM DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EFFORTS.    AS FURTHER INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN, SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS WILL BE FILED AS REQUIRED.    SEE ATTACHED UPLOADED FILE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE AS OF DECEMBER 20, 2010.

THE POSSIBLE PRODUCT RELEASE LOCATION WAS DISCOVERED BY UTILITY VEHICLE RIDERS THAT WERE ON A TRAIL THAT CROSSES THE PIPELINE ROW.  THE COLONIAL EMPLOYEE LIVES IN THE AREA AND WENT TO INSPECT THE LOCATION.  UPON INSPECTION, THE COLONIAL EMPLOYEE CONFIRMED A PRODUCT RELEASE VISIBLE AT THE GROUND SURFACE AT 18:42 NEAR MILE MARKER 980 THAT WAS BELIEVED TO BE GASOLINE.  THE COLONIAL EMPLOYEE CONTACTED THE COLONIAL CONTROL CENTER IN ALPHARETTA, GA TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION OF THE VISIBLE RELEASE AND THE CONTROL CENTER INITIATED SHUTDOWN OF LINES 1 AND 2 AT 18:43. THE LINES WERE BLOCKED BY CLOSING VALVES UPSTREAM OF THE RELEASE LOCATION AT COLONIAL'S CHARLOTTE DELIVERY FACILITY (DF) AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE RELEASE LOCATION AT THE KANNAPOLIS STATION.  THE COLONIAL OPERATIONS MANAGER (OM) WAS NOTIFIED AT 18:44, AND THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS (DO) WAS NOTIFIED AT 19:00, FOLLOWED BY AN INTERNAL TIER 2 RESPONSE NOTIFICATION AT 19:32 TO MOBILIZE INTERNAL AND CONTRACTOR RESOURCES TO THE SITE, AND ESTABLISHED AN INCIDENT COMMAND POST TO SUPPORT THE RESPONSE.

THE PRODUCT RELEASE SOURCE WAS ORIGINATING FROM BENEATH A PRIOR REPAIR (TYPE A SLEEVE) MADE IN 2004 TO ADDRESS A PIPELINE ANOMALY IDENTIFIED THROUGH A PREVIOUS INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT. THE PRODUCT RELEASE WAS REPAIRED BY INSTALLING A TYPE B PRESSURE CONTAINING SLEEVE OVER THE PRIOR TYPE A SLEEVE REPAIR ON 8/19/2020.  LINE 1 WAS RESTARTED ON 8/19/2020 AT APPROXIMATELY 21:00 AFTER THE REPAIR WORK WAS COMPLETED.    SUPPLEMENTED ON 9/14/2020 TO UPDATE ESTIMATED COST OF COMMODITY LOST.

NARRATIVE UPDATE 8/11/2017    THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) RELEASED A PIPELINE ACCIDENT BRIEF (PAB) ON 6/15/2017 WHICH PRESENTED THE RESULTS OF ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE CENTREVILLE INCIDENT (PAB-17/01, ADOPTED BY NTSB ON 6/5/2017). AS PROVIDED IN THE PAB, NTSB DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS A ""THROUGHWALL CORROSION FATIGUE THAT DEVELOPED AT A DENT IN THE PIPELINE DUE TO RESIDUAL AND OPERATIONAL STRESS & EXPOSURE TO THE UNDERGROUND ENVIRONMENT"". COLONIAL CONCURS THAT THE CRACK DEVELOPED DUE TO FATIGUE CAUSED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING PRESSURE CYCLING, BUT COLONIAL DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENCE OF CORROSION AT THE FAILURE SITE HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE LEAK OCCURRENCE. CORROSION AT THE LEAK LOCATION WAS TOO LIMITED TO HAVE ANY APPRECIABLE IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND FULL THROUGH-WALL PROPAGATION OF A CRACK.    PHMSA'S ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION DIVISION DIRECTED COLONIAL TO INCLUDE THE SPECIFIC DATES/TIMES AS SET FORTH IN THIS FORM'S PART A #4, #18A, AND #18B.  NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, HOWEVER, COLONIAL MAINTAINS:  (1) AS TO #4 - THE APPROPRIATE DATE/TIME OF THE ACCIDENT (I.E., WHEN 'ACCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA WAS MET') IS ""9/21/2015  20:53"", WHEN COLONIAL RECEIVED THE CALL FROM THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE MARSHAL REPORTING A SHEEN ON THE RETENTION POND.   (2) AS TO #18A - THE APPROPRIATE DATE/TIME WHEN COLONIAL 'IDENTIFIED THE ACCIDENT' IS ""9/23/2015 09:57"", WHEN COLONIAL CONFIRMED THAT THE RELEASE ORIGINATED FROM ITS PIPELINE.  PRIOR TO THAT TIME, COLONIAL HAD NOT 'IDENTIFIED THE FAILURE' - COLONIAL'S PIPELINES WERE LOCATED SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE POND AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF THE ODORS AND/OR SHEEN.  IN RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF A SHEEN, COLONIAL INITIATED THE SHUTDOWN OF ITS PIPELINE AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, EVEN THOUGH THE SOURCE HAD NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. COLONIAL REPORTED GASOLINE 'FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE' TO THE NRC ON 9/22/2015 AT 01:32. COLONIAL 'IDENTIFIED THE FAILURE' ON 9/23/2015 AT 09:57 WHEN PRODUCT WAS OBSERVED LEAKING FROM COLONIAL'S LINE 4 PIPELINE.  UNTIL THAT TIME, THERE WAS NO DEFINITIVE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SHEEN ON THE RETENTION POND AND COLONIAL'S PIPELINE, WHICH WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE POND.   (3) AS TO #18B - THE APPROPRIATE DATE/TIME WHEN COLONIAL 'RESOURCES ARRIVED ON SITE' IS ""9/23/2015 09:57"".  COLONIAL RESOURCES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE PRIOR TO THAT DATE/TIME, BUT THIS FORM'S INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDE THAT #18B MUST BE CONCURRENT WITH OR LATER THAN #18A (WHEN THE ACCIDENT WAS IDENTIFIED BY COLONIAL).     UPDATE APRIL 2020: DURING THE TIME PERIOD THAT THIS RELEASE OCCURRED, COLONIAL HAD EXPERIENCED SEVERAL OTHER RELEASES THAT HAD THE SAME FAILURE MODE.  THE IA THAT FOLLOWED THIS INCIDENT WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH THE OTHER RECENT FATIGUE CRACK IN DENT FAILURES, AND WAS ADDRESSED AS ONE COMPREHENSIVE, SYSTEM-WIDE ASSESSMENT OF THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FATIGUE CRACKS IN DENTS.  THIS APPROACH WAS TAKEN BY COLONIAL TO ENSURE THAT THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM ALL OF THE INCIDENTS COULD BE FACTORED INTO THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN AND DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM-WIDE.     THE IA INCLUDED METALLURGICAL ANALYSES OF THREE OF THE DENT FAILURES, ALL CONFIRMING THAT PRESSURE CYCLING OF THE DENT RESULTED IN THROUGH WALL FATIGUE CRACKS.
