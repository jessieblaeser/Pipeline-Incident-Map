VECTREN PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED THE VALVE TO THE SERVICE LINE PROVIDING NATURAL GAS TO THE STRUCTURE.     AN INITIAL REPORT FROM THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THE STRUCTURE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS 'TOTALLY DESTROYED AND REDUCED TO A FLAMING PILE OF RUBBLE'.  IT FURTHER DESCRIBED THE DAMAGE TO ADJACENT STRUCTURES INCLUDING BLOWN OUT WINDOWS, A COLLAPSED EXTERIOR WALL AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF FIRE TO THE ROOF LINES.     THE INITIAL REPORT ALSO COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE CAUSE REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION, THE PRELIMINARY THOUGHT IS THAT 'EXCAVATION WORK AROUND A NATURAL GAS LINE CAUSED THE LINE TO FRACTURE ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASEMENT WALL'' 'ALLOWING THE FREE FLOW OF GAS TO FILL THE INTERIOR OF THE STRUCTURE AND A UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE SPARKED THE EXPLOSION.'    VECTREN IS CONTINUING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN OF THIS INCIDENT.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT NARRATIVE, JANUARY 10, 2012:    THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE FOR THE DUPLEX AT 367-369 WAYNE DRIVE RAN UNDERGROUND FROM THE CURB BOX THROUGH THE CONCRETE BASEMENT WALL INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  AFTER GOING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE BASEMENT WALL, THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE THEN WENT TO THE LEFT AT A TEE CONNECTION TO THE METER FOR 367 WAYNE DRIVE AND THEN TO THE RIGHT AT AN NINETY DEGREE ELBOW THROUGH THE BLOCK WALL, DIVIDING THE BASEMENTS, TO THE METER FOR 369 WAYNE DRIVE.      VECTREN GENERALLY CONCLUDES THAT THE BACKHOE OPERATOR, DIGGING A TRENCH OUTSIDE THE BASEMENT FOUNDATION BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE DUPLEX, DAMAGED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE.  THIS DAMAGE CAUSED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE TO BEND AND PULL AND TO PLACE A LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE AND THE THREADS THAT SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW INSIDE THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THIS LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION CAUSED THE THREADS OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE, WHICH WERE SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW, TO FRACTURE AT THIS THREAD JOINT RELEASING NATURAL GAS INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THE NATURAL GAS EXPLODED FROM AN UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE ONCE THE NATURAL GAS AND AIR MIXTURE HAD REACHED A POINT BETWEEN THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT AND THE UPPER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.  THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION DID NOT CAUSE THE FRACTURE TO THIS THREAD JOINT.      VECTREN'S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF MERCAPTAN OR ODORANT WAS IN THE NATURAL GAS AT THE TIME AND THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER NATURAL GAS LEAKS.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND LEAK TIGHT.  VECTREN'S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO REQUESTS TO LOCATE THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE BEFORE THESE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS AND THAT THERE WAS NO REQUEST TO TURN OFF THE NATURAL GAS.  ALTHOUGH VECTREN DOES NOT RELY ON THE INITIAL REPORT OF THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE INCIDENT REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL, VECTREN'S CONCLUSIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THESE REPORTS.",8.0,,,367/369 WAYNE DRIVE,FAIRBORN,OH,390572003002011,39,057,200300,39057200300,1400000US39057200300,"Census Tract 2003, Greene County, Ohio",3796,39057200300

OF A WORKING FIRE AT 4213 S 13TH ST.. DISTRICT PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND ASSISTED THE OFD IN SHUTTING OFF THE GAS TO THIS RESIDENCE. IT WAS THEN DETERMINED THAT IT APPEARD THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL OF A NATURAL GAS EXPLOSION/IGNITION THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT/LOSS. THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE IGNITION SOURCE OR THE AREA WHERE GAS MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED AS OF YET. ON 3/14/12 THERE WILL BE A COMBINED INVESTIGATION WITH SEVERAL PARTIES OF INTEREST TO TRY AND LOCATE THE ORIGIN OF THE LEAK AND OR THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS.      10/11/12- OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE COCK VALVE ON THE INSIDE OF THE DWELLING HAD A LEAK IN THE PACKING AND THE GAS ESCAPED THE COCK VALVE AND MIGRATED TOWARDS THE FURNACE AREA OF THE DWELLING. DUE TO THE HOUSE BEING VACANT AND VENELATION WAS MINIMAL THERE ENDED UP BEING A BUILD UP IN THE FURNACE AREA AND WHEN THE FURNACE CYCLED IT IGNITED THE GAS AND THE RESULT OF THIS IGNITION WAS THE LOSS OF THIS DWELLING. THE GAS SERVICE TO THE DWELLING WAS ABANDONED AT THE MAIN ON THE DAY OF THE LOSS AND THE DWELLING SINCE HAS BEEN TORN DOWN DUE TO THE LOSS.    10/22/12- THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE INSIDE METER, THE OPERATOR OWNED COCK VALVE LEAKED IN THE PACKING AND RELEASED NATURAL GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE NATURAL GAS THAT WAS RELEASED, WHICH WAS THE FUEL SOURCE,IGNITED WHEN THE FURNACE CYCLED AND THE RESULT WAS THE LOSS THAT WAS BEEN REPORTED.  OUR INVESTIGATION IS CLOSED IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER AND THIS ENTRY SHALL SERVE AS OUR FINAL ENTRY IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER.     11/10/14- MUD HAS CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AND, AS A RESULT, NOW DRAWS A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THAN PREVIOUSLY ENTERED ON THIS REPORT. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONTINUED INVESTIGATION, MUD BELIEVES THAT THE PRIMARY GAS SOURCE THAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE WAS THE INLET SWIVEL AND NOT THE GAS COCK VALVE. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED UPON THE CONDITION OF THE METER, THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIRE WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MUD PERSONAL ARRIVED ON SCENE AND MUD EMPLOYEE'S EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GAS AND GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. MUD BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY WAY THE INLET SWIVEL COULD HAVE HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS FOR THE INLET SWIVEL TO HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY LOOSENED FROM THE GAS METER. MUD BELIEVES THAT THE GAS COCK VALVE MOST LIKELY BECAME LOOSENED AS A RESULT OF THE EXTREME HEAT FROM THE INITIAL EXPLOSION AND RESULTING FIRE BUT THAT THE GAS COCK VALVE DID NOT CAUSE THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE.

THE LEAKAGE EXTENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND THE DECISION TO SHUT THE MAIN DOWN ALONG WITH 8 CUSTOMERS WAS MADE.  THE VALVE TO SHUT THE LINE DOWN WAS TURNED AT 05:26 HOURS.  THE 2"" MAIN LINE SERVICING THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND CUT ON THE NORTH END AND SOUTH END OUTSIDE OF THE LEAKAGE AREA.  APPROXIMATELY 250' OF 2"" PLASTIC MAIN LINE WAS INSTALLED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF UTAH AVENUE.  THE NEW LINE WAS TIE BACK INTO THE EXISTING LINE IN A MANNER THAT ISOLATED THE GAS MAIN IN THE LEAKAGE AREA.  THE OLD LINE WAS CAPPED TO PRESERVE THE LINE FOR FURTHER TESTING.  GAS SERVICE WAS REESTABLISHED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  ODORANT READINGS WERE TAKEN AND FOUND TO BE WELL WITHIN REQUIRED LIMITS.  THE REMAINDER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SURVEYED FOR LEAKAGE TO ENSURE THE AREA WAS SAFE AS IT RELATED TO GAS SERVICE.  AT 09:00 ON MAY 16TH , 2012 WE RETURNED TO THE SITE TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE ISOLATED MAIN LINE AT NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE (43#) TO TEST FOR LEAKAGE.  WE FOUND LEAKAGE ON THE ISOLATED 191' OF 2"" BARE STEEL.  WE ISOLATED APPROXIMATELY 90' NORTH OF THE 36 S. UTAH DRIVEWAY AND PRESSURE TESTED IT.  WE FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE TESTED THE SOUTHERN SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 100') AND FOUND LEAKAGE.  WE EXCAVATED TO EXPOSE THE MAIN LINE JUST SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY TO 36 S. UTAH AND CUT THE MAIN TO ISOLATE APROXIMATELY 45' THAT WAS UNDER THE DRIVE WAY.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE 65'SECTION SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STRUCTURE AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  THIS ISOLATED THE LEAKAGE TO THE 45' SECTION LOCATED UNDER THE DRIVEWAY.

HE DID NOT NOTIFY FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILITIES BUT LOOKED FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR HIMSELF ON TUESDAY, 8/28/12.  ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT IS A PICTURE OF A SECTION OF 3/4"" BARE STEEL SERVICE THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED AT 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH. IT APPEARS TO HAVE A HOLE CAUSED BY AN ELECTRICAL ARC.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS DETERMINIED THAT THE 3/4"" BS GAS SERVICE WAS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A CAST IRON SEWER LINE AND A GALVANIZED ELECTRICAL CONDUIT. THE ELECTRICAL CONDUIT WAS INSTALLED AT SOME POINT AFTER THE GAS SERVICE WAS INSTALLED WHEN THE GARAGE WAS CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT AND A CONCRETE SLAB WAS POURED OVER THEM ON THE GROUND.    STRAY CURRENT EITHER FROM AN ELECTIC POWER POLE OR INDUCED UPON THE  CONDUIT AND PIPING CAUSED AN ARC BETWEEN THE CONDUIT AND PIPES RESULTING IN A SMALL HOLE IN THE GAS PIPING. GAS LEAKED UNDER THE SLAB AS A RESULT OF THE ARC HOLE BEGINNING ON 8/24/12 AND VENTED INTO THE GARAGE APARTMENT. WHEN THE RESIDENT OF 410 59TH ST. BEGAN TO LOOK FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR ON 8/28/12, HE LIT A CIGARETTE, IGNITING THE GAS IN THE APARTMENT.      5/28/2015 - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT FILED ON 4/28/2014.   1. THE LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE COORDINATES WERE CORRECTED FROM THE ORIGINAL COORDINATES THAT WERE OBTAINED FROM GOOGLE MAPS AND WERE SLIGHTLY INACCURATE.  2. THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS CHANGED FROM G2 - NATURAL FORCE DAMAGE (LIGHTNING) TO G4 - OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE (ELECTRICAL ARCING). ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LIGHTNING IN THE AREA DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, THE EXACT SOURCE OF THE CURRENT THAT ARCED A HOLE IN THE GAS SERVICE COULD NOT BE DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION.  3. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS REVIEWED AND LEFT AS STATED. THE DAMAGE AND REMOVAL OF DEBRIS WERE CONFINED TO AN UNPERMITTED AND UNINHABITED DETACHED GARAGE THAT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT. THE REPAIR OF THE GAS MAIN CONSISTED OF INSTALLING A STOP FITTING AND INSERTING APPROX. 100' OF STEEL MAIN WITH PE PIPE AND RUNNING APPROX. 33' OF PE SERVICE. THE ASSESSED VALUE FOR THE ENTIRE PROPERTY AT 410 59TH ST, WEST PALM BEACH WAS $75,210 WITH A MARKET VALUE OF $92,639 IN 2012.

IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT AN UNDERGROUND STEEL DISTRIBUTION VALVE, 2 INCH IN DIAMETER, HAD A CRACKED FLANGE.  THIS LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY REMOVING THE VALVE ALONG WITH ANOTHER SIMILIAR VALVE AND REPLACING IT WITH COATED STEEL PIPE.  THE LEAK WAS TWENTY FEET AWAY FROM THE DWELLING AT 851 WASHINGTON ST.  GAS SERVICE WAS THEN RESTORED TO THE AREA AT 0745 (7:45AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.      AFTER THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED HU GAS DEPARTMENT CREWS BEGAN TO CONDUCT A NUMBER OF TESTS IN THE VICINTY OF 851 WASHINGTON ST.  THESE TESTS INCLUDED A LEAK SURVEY, CATHODIC PROTECTION PIPE TO SOIL READINGS, BAR HOLE TEST AND A PRESSURE TEST OF ALL THREE GAS SERVICE LINES TO 851 WASHINGTON ST., AS THIS BUILDING WAS A TRI-PLEX COMPRISED OF UNITS A, B, AND C.  ALL THREE GAS SERVICES HELD THE TEST PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATLY +125 PSIG WITH NO LEAKS INDICATED.  A TEST OF THE FUEL LINE (CUSTOMER PIPING) AT UNIT C FAILED, INDICATING A LEAK INSIDE THE UNIT.    AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS ON GOING.  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR(S) MAY HAVE BEEN THE LEAK ON THE FUEL LINE, THE UNDERGROUND GAS LEAK OR SOME OTHER FACTOR.    THE LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WERE A TEMPERATURE OF 37 DEGREES FARENHEIT,  THE WIND SPEED WAS 5 MPH, NO WIND GUSTS, WIND DIRECTION WAS 300 (GENERALLY OUT OF THE NORTHWEST).  IT WAS OVERCAST WITH A LIGHT RAINFALL.    A SUPPLEMENTAL OR SUPPLEMENTAL PLUS FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED AS SOON AS NEW, UPDATED AND/OR CORRECTED INFORMATION IS KNOWN.    SEPTEMBER 8, 2016-THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT. EXPERT WITNESSES DETERMINED THAT SOMETHING HEAVY LIKE A VEHICLE RAN OVER A VALVE BOX CAUSING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON A 2 INCH FLANGED ROCKWELL FIGURE 143 VALVE CAUSING THE VALVE TO CRACK IN A FLANGE.

THE CREW HAD INSTALLED A 2 INCH PLASTIC BYPASS AROUND THE LEAK AND HAD SQUEEZED OFF THE 4 INCH MAIN TO STOP OFF THE GAS. WHILE PREPARING FOR THE MAIN CUT OUT OF 4 INCH PLASTIC, A SUDDEN RUSH OF GAS OCCURRED AND THEN THE GAS IGNITED CAUSING A FIRE TO OCCUR IN THE EXCAVATION. THERE WERE 2 EMPLOYEES IN THE EXCAVATION WHO WERE ABLE TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THE HOLE JUST BEFORE THE IGNITION OCCURRED. ONE OF THESE EMPLOYEES DID RECEIVE SOME BURNS AND WAS TREATED AND RELEASED FROM A HOSPITAL. THE RESULTING FIRE ALSO SPREAD TO AN NSTAR BACKHOE PARKED AT THE EXCAVATION. THE SHREWSBURY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO CONTROL THE GAS FIRE. AT 1:50 PM A MAIN VALVE ON COLONIAL DR. WAS SHUT TO STOP THE LEAKING GAS AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. THIS RESULTED IN AN OUTAGE TO 135 CUSTOMERS. NSTAR HAD TO REPLACE ABOUT 20 FEET OF 4 INCH PLASTIC MAIN DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE.

SOCALGAS EXCAVATED AND PINCHED THE SERVICE TO STOP THE GAS FLOW.  A SO CAL EDISON CREW WORKING NEAR THE RESIDENCE REPORTED THAT HIGH WINDS HAD CAUSED TWO POWER LINES TO COME IN CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.  THE EDISON CREW SAID THIS CAUSED THE NEARBY TRANSFORMER TO BLOW CAUSING 12,000 VOLTS TO GO TO GROUND.  THE CUSTOMER OF THE INVOLVED RESIDENCE REPORTED THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE (PRESUMABLY THE TRANSFORMER) AND THE LIGHTS INSIDE THE HOME FLASHED OFF AND ON BEFORE FINALLY REMAINING OFF.

THE CALLER STATED THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED AND THAT THERE WAS ALSO GAS BURNING. WE ENERGIES IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED A FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SITE.  THE FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 11:47 A.M. AND OBSERVED A STRUCTURE FIRE; BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF AN EXPLOSION. THE EMPLOYEE NOTED THAT THE STRUCTURE FIRE WAS ESSENTIALLY UNDER CONTROL BUT NATURAL GAS WAS BURNING AT THE OUTSIDE METER AND AT A FEW LOCATIONS ON THE GROUND NEAR THE BUILDING. THE FIRST RESPONDER SAW THAT MORE RESOURCES WERE NEEDED TO REMOTELY SHUT OFF THE GAS AND MADE THE REQUEST TO THE DISPATCHER. THE FIRST RESPONDER AND ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WHO HAD ARRIVED PROCEEDED TO CHECK FOR GAS MIGRATION AND WORK WITH FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO KEEP A SAFE PERIMETER. INITIAL PROBING AND RECHECKS VERIFIED THAT GAS WAS ONLY IN THE AREA OF THE STRUCTURE FIRE.  AT ABOUT 12:52 P.M., MORE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND BEGAN DIGGING TO REMOTELY SQUEEZE OFF GAS ON THIS ONE-WAY FEED TO 2800 LAKESHORE WAY AND THE PROPERTY TO THE NORTH. A FROST DEPTH OF ABOUT 3 FT. MADE EXCAVATION HARD, AND THE 1958-INSTALLED 1 1/4 IN. STEEL GAS MAIN TO THE PROPERTIES WAS SQUEEZED OFF AT ABOUT 3:09 P.M. ALL FIRE AT THE PROPERTY WAS EXTINGUISHED SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  TO CONFIRM THE UNOCCUPIED HOME TO THE NORTH WAS SAFE, ACCESS WAS GAINED WITH POLICE ASSISTANCE AT ABOUT 1:30 P.M. AND ALL THREE LEVELS CHECKED AT 0%.  DUE TO THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE POTENTIALLY CAUSED BY GAS LEAKAGE FROM OPERATOR FACILITIES, A PHONE NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT ABOUT 4:00 P.M. TO REPORT THIS EVENT AS A POSSIBLE INCIDENT PER 49 CFR PART 191.3. THE WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (WPSC) WAS ALSO NOTIFIED.  A LINE STOPPER WAS INSTALLED AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY BY ABOUT 6:30 P.M. ON 1/30/14. AFTER VERIFYING THAT THE SITE WAS SAFE, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO WAIT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY TO CONDUCT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.  ON 1/31/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE FOR INVESTIGATIONS. INITIAL PRESSURE TESTING OF THE ABANDONED MAIN AND SERVICE INDICATED AN UNDERGROUND LEAK, AND IT WAS BELIEVED NECESSARY TO EXCAVATE AT THE SERVICE TEE. SINCE THE PROPERTY OWNERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH MOVING NECESSARY PERSONAL PROPERTY, FURTHER EXCAVATION WAS DELAYED UNTIL FEBRUARY 4TH.  ON 2/4/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. UPON EXCAVATION AT THE SERVICE TEE LOCATION FOR 2800 LAKESHORE WAY, A BENT SECTION OF MAIN WAS IDENTIFIED. THE MAIN WAS BENT IN AN ARC, AND WAS DISPLACED VERTICALLY BY ABOUT 3 IN. OVER A 6 FT. LENGTH. THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE WAS FLATTENED AND A CRACK WAS FOUND IN THE BENT SECTION OF THE PIPE. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING A PRIOR EXCAVATION AND THAT MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE DEEP FROST LEVELS OBSERVED THIS WINTER CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE. ONE-CALL CENTER RECORDS DO NOT INDICATE ANY RECENT LOCATE TICKET REQUESTS AND IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE EXCAVATION ACTIVITY THAT DAMAGED THE PIPE OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO.  A NEW PE MAIN WAS INSTALLED ON LAKESHORE WAY AND GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED PROPERTY WAS RESTORED ON 2/14/14.  A FORMAL INCIDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 2/21/14. PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVIEW INCLUDED GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKERS AT THE SCENE AFTER THE FIRE WAS REPORTED AND OTHER COMPANY PERSONNEL WHO ASSISTED AT THE SCENE.

A READING OF 70% LEL AT THE FRONT FOUNDATION WALL TO 1845 S. BANCROFT WAS REPORTED BY THE TECHNICIAN TO THE FSD DISPATCHER.  BASED ON THIS REPORT, A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS DISPATCHED AT 18:10.  FSD AND DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISION WERE ALSO DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION.  THE CREW ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 18:24 AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR INVESTIGATION.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WHILE THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND THE FSD TECHNICIAN WERE INSIDE THE PROPERTY AT 1849 S. BANCROFT CHECKING FOR GAS READINGS, AN EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 19:05 INSIDE 1849 S. BANCROFT.  THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE TWO RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT 1849 AND 1847 S. BANCROFT.  IT ALSO INJURED BOTH PGW EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE, AS WELL AS ONE HOMEOWNER.  THE INJURIES SUSTAINED BY ALL THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE NON-LIFE THREATENING.  BOTH THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND HOMEOWNER WERE TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT AND RELEASED ON THE SAME DAY WHILE THE FSD TECHNICIAN WAS ADMITTED WITH BURNS TO HIS NECK AND LOWER TORSO.  THE EXPLOSION AT THE SCENE WAS OBSERVED BY A FSD SUPERVISOR WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 19:05.  PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT, PHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND PECO ENERGY WERE CALLED IN FOR ASSISTANCE, IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS PGW RESOURCES SUCH AS, DISTRIBUTION CREWS, FSD TECHNICIANS, MOBILE EQUIPMENT, GREASE TRUCK, SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL, CHEMICAL SERVICES, ETC.  THE PAPUC WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.    THE GAS MAIN IN THE EAST FOOTWAY IN FRONT OF 1849 S. BANCROFT (4"" 1939 LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN) WAS GREASED OFF THROUGH A PLASTIC SERVICE TO 1843 S. BANCROFT AT 19:51 AND THE LEAK CONSEQUENTLY WAS MADE SAFE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GREASING OFF, A TOTAL OF FOUR (4) PROPERTIES WERE TEMPORARILY OUT OF GAS.  PECO ALSO SHUT OFF THE ELECTRIC POWER TO 1849 S. BANCROFT AT 21:00.  AFTER MAKING THE JOB SAFE AND RECEIVING THE GO AHEAD FROM PFD, PGW PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE CONTINUED WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  EVERY BUILDING ON THE 1800 BLOCK OF S. BANCROFT WAS CHECKED FOR GAS READINGS.  ALSO, THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN ON THE BLOCK ALONG WITH ALL ACTIVE GAS SERVICES WERE BAR HOLED IN ORDER TO CHECK FOR ANY POSSIBLE LEAKS.  DURING THIS BLOCK CHECK THE CREW PICKED UP LEL READINGS IN FRONT OF 1835 AND 1816/1818.  A BROKEN MAIN WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND AND REPAIRED IN FRONT OF 1818 AND A TOTAL OF SIX (6) SERVICES ON THE BLOCK WERE RENEWED WITH PLASTIC.  THE GREASED 4"" MAIN WAS ALSO CUT AND CAPPED AT 03:45.  THIS PORTION OF THE 4"" MAIN THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED (100') WAS AIR TESTED AT 6"" WC AND THE TEST FAILED.  THIS SECTION OF THE MAIN WAS THEN EXCAVATED COMPLETELY AND A BROKEN MAIN WAS FOUND IN FRONT OF 1849.  AN 8' SECTION OF THE PIPE, CONTAINING THE BROKEN MAIN, WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION, TAGGED AS EVIDENCE AND TRANSPORTED TO THE PGW EVIDENCE ROOM ON 1/31/2014.  IT IS BELIEVED FROST HEAVE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE BROKEN MAIN, FOURTEEN INCHES OF FROST WAS MEASURED AT THIS LOCATION. THE SERVICES TO 1845 AND 1847 (BOTH 1 1/4"" UNPROTECTED STEEL SERVICES) WERE ALSO AIR TESTED AND FAILED.  AFTER THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED, THE GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE SHUT OFF DURING THE GREASE OFF PROCESS.  THE BUILDING AT 1849 WAS DEMOLISHED ON 2/1/2014. PGW SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN.    ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT PIPE SHOWED THAT IT NEVER COMPLETELY FRACTURED CIRCUMFERENTIALLY AND THE CRACK WAS CONSIDERED TIGHT WITH NO LARGE GAP BETWEEN THE MATING SURFACES. THE CAST IRON MAIN EXHIBITED GRAPHITIZATION BUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPE WOULD HAVE PERSISTED IF LEFT UNDISTURBED AND NOT UNDER LOADING CONDITIONS.

SHE TURNED THE FLAME DOWN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THE STOVE AND SUDDENLY NOTICED THAT SHE WAS ON THE GROUND WITH DEBRIS FALLING FROM THE CEILING AND FIRE AROUND HER.  SHE TRIED TO GO TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS SLEEPING BUT COULD NOT AND SO SHE WALKED THROUGH THE GARAGE TO GET OUTSIDE.    THAT PORTION OF THE 1"" STEEL SERVICE WITH THE CRACK AT ITS THREADED END WAS BELOW GROUND AND AT LEAST TWO LAYERS OF CONCRETE WITH MORTAR AND SALTILLO TILE ABOVE THAT.  THE TOP LAYER OF CONCRETE, MORTAR AND TILE WERE ALL INSTALLED AROUND THE RISER WITHOUT A SLEEVE OR SPACE TO ALLOW OR ACCOMMODATE FOR MOVEMENT CAUSED BY SHIFTING, SETTLING, EXPANDING OR CONTRACTING SOIL.  THE BOTTOM LAYER OF CONCRETE HAD A VOID AROUND THE RISER WHICH SERVED AS A SLEEVE OR SPACE THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE FOR SUCH MOVEMENT.  MOVING SOIL ACTING ON THE IMMOVABLE RISER ENCASED IN CONCRETE, MORTAR AND TILE MAY HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK AT THE THREADED END OF THE SERVICE LINE.  INITIAL VISUAL METALLURGIC EXAMINATION OF THE CRACK AT THE THREADED END OF THE SERVICE DID NOT SHOW OBVIOUS SIGNS OF CORROSION.

PIN BAR TESTING WAS PERFORMED AT THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE METER, WHERE 15% GAS READS WERE FOUND.  ADDITIONAL BAR TESTING REVEALED SUSTAINED 95% GAS READS AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND 100% GAS READS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET WEST OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE ROAD.  A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS EVIDENT IN THIS LOCATION.  FIRST RESPONDERS THEN TOOK GAS READINGS INSIDE THE BASEMENT AFTER BEING ESCORTED IN BY THE FIRE MARSHALL.    BAR TESTING AT ADJACENT HOUSES (SOUTH AND WEST OF 2754 WILDER) PRODUCED NO GAS READS.    AT 1:42 AM ON MARCH 1, A GAS DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED AND EXPOSED THE 2 INCH STEEL MAIN IN FRONT OF (WEST OF) 2754 WILDER.  THE MAIN WAS BENT, CRACKED AND LEAKING.  THE CREW OPENED UP THE HOLE TO VENT THE BLOWING GAS.  A FROST BALL ON THE LEAK WAS KNOCKED OFF AT 5:45 AM, AT WHICH POINT THE GAS BEGAN BLOWING.  AT 9:20 AM, A 2"" PLIDCO REPAIR SLEEVE, WHICH STOPPED THE LEAK AND REPAIRED THE MAIN. INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS DAMAGE DURING INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN; THE EXACT TIME PERIOD OF THE WATER MAIN INSTALLATION IS UNKNOWN. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED ON THE OBSERVED DAMAGE AND PROXIMITY OF THE WATER MAIN. THE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE. A SEARCH OF MISS DIG STAKING REQUESTS FOR THIS LOCATION DID NOT YIELD ANY RECENT STAKING TICKETS WITHIN THE LAST 15 MONTHS.    THE ORIGIN OF THE HOUSEFIRE WAS APPARENTLY THE BASEMENT OF THE HOME.  ALTHOUGH AN ON-SCENE INVESTIGATOR REPRESENTING THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE COMPANY (STATE FARM) INDICATED THAT THE GAS LEAK MAY HAVE CAUSED THE FIRE, FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION BY CONSUMERS ENERGY INDICATES THAT THIS SCENARIO IS UNLIKELY.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF AN EXPLOSION OR INDEED IGNITION OF GAS IN THE HOME, AND WHILE THERE WERE EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF GAS DETECTED IN THE BASEMENT BY FIRST RESPONDERS (0.16% GAS READS, OR 4% LEL), THIS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS (INCLUDING THOSE IN THE BASEMENT) BEING OPENED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, ALLOWING GAS TO ENTER THE HOME FROM OUTSIDE.  THERE WERE NO APPARENT CRACKS OR HOLES IN THE BASEMENT WALL WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE PROVIDE A PATH OF MIGRATION INTO THE HOME, AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND ON THE METER OR THE STEEL GAS SERVICE TO THE HOME.  FURTHERMORE, THE MAJORITY OF FIRE DAMAGE WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE BASEMENT (THE SIDE CLOSEST TO THE GAS FACILITIES)    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF ON SITE WAS ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO COME TO A DETERMINATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSEFIRE.  DUE TO THE LACK OF CERTAINTY ABOUT THE SOURCE OF FIRE, AS WELL AS PROPERTY DAMAGE WITHIN THE HOME (DAMAGES TO APPLIANCES AND SMOKE DAMAGE) LIKELY EXCEEDING $50,000, THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. DAMAGE ESTIMATES FROM THE FIRE OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS INVESTIGATORS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $50,000 TO $110,000; INSURANCE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES STATED THAT THE HOME WAS INSURED TO A VALUE OF $160,000.

BEFORE THEY REACHED CYPRESS LANE, THE CREW WAS FLAGGED DOWN BY A POLICE OFFICER AT THE INTERSECTION OF OAK AVENUE AND ROUTE 9, WHO INFORMED THEM THAT THERE WAS A GAS ODOR ON OAK AVENUE. THEREAFTER, AT 9:15 A.M. A FIRST RESPONDER WAS DISPATCHED TO OAK AVENUE AND ARRIVED AT ABOUT 9:24 A.M. A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS IDENTIFIED NEAR 59 OAK AVENUE. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT NO ONE WAS IN THE BUILDING. POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL WERE ALREADY ON SITE AND HAD EVACUATED NEIGHBORING HOMES.  SOON THEREAFTER, THREE ADDITIONAL CREWS ARRIVED AT 59 OAK AVENUE. A LEAK IN THE STREET WAS LOCATED AND THE CREWS BEGAN JACKHAMMERING THE PAVEMENT.

BETWEEN 2115 AND 2130, THE MACHINE STRUCK A HAWAII GAS (""HG"") UNDERGROUND MAIN LINE, CAUSING AN APPROXIMATELY 9.5-INCH TEAR IN THE MAIN.  THE DAMAGED SEGMENT WAS 4-INCH STEEL PIPE COATED WITH XTC (""SUBJECT SEGMENT""). THE SUBJECT SEGMENT BEGAN TO LEAK GAS AND AT AN UNVERIFIED TIME, THE GAS IGNITED AROUND THE MACHINE. TWO RB EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRE AND ONE REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION. THE HONOLULU FIRE DEPARTMENT (""HFD"") RESPONDED AND DIRECTED WATER AT THE MACHINE TO PREVENT ITS FUEL TANKS FROM OVERHEATING. HG STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE SUBJECT SEGMENT AT APPROXIMATELY 0253 ON 06/16/2015, THE FIRE DISSIPATED SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND HFD ANNOUNCED AN ""ALL CLEAR"" AT APPROXIMATELY 0300.    HG PRE-INCIDENT ACTIVITY    HG INSTALLED THE SUBJECT SEGMENT IN 1977. ON 02/09/2015, RB SUBMITTED ONE CALL TICKET 15001196 (THE ""TICKET"") TO THE HAWAII ONE CALL CENTER STATING THAT RB WOULD BE EXCAVATING AN AREA OF KAPAHULU AVENUE (THE ""EXCAVATION AREA""), INCLUDING THE SUBJECT SEGMENT. HG RESPONDED TO THE TICKET BY REVIEWING EXCAVATION AREA MAPS AND DETERMINING THAT AN UNDERGROUND MAIN WAS LOCATED THEREIN. ON 02/19/2015, HG PERFORMED CONDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE TONING IN THE EXCAVATION AREA AND MARKED THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LINE ON THE ROADWAY SURFACE WITH YELLOW PAINT.    HG RESPONSE TO INCIDENT    HG WAS ALERTED TO THE INCIDENT IN TWO WAYS: 1) THE HG SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS PLANT RECORDED A PRESSURE IRREGULARITY IN THE GAS PIPELINE AND NOTIFIED HG DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 2130; AND 2) HFD NOTIFIED HG DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 2138. AN HG OPERATIONS SUPERINTENDENT ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 2200. OTHER HG PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED BETWEEN 2145 AND 2215, AND BEGAN ARRIVING AT THE HG KAMAKEE BASEYARD BETWEEN 2215 AND 2300. THE HG SUPERVISORY TEAM CONCLUDED THAT THE MAIN LINE WOULD NEED TO BE EXCAVATED AND STOPPED AT THREE LOCATIONS: NORTH, SOUTH AND WEST OF THE INCIDENT. HG PERSONNEL INSTALLED LINE STOPPERS AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH SITES AND PINCHED THE LINE AT THE WEST SITE. GAS FLOW TO THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS STOPPED AT APPROXIMATELY 0253 ON 06/16/15.    STATUTORY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT    (1) HAWAII ONE CALL STATUTE    THE HAWAII ONE CALL STATUTE REQUIRES AN EXCAVATOR TO PROVIDE EXCAVATION LOCATION TO THE ONE CALL CENTER PRIOR TO EXCAVATING, AND THE CENTER NOTIFIES UTILITY OPERATORS ABOUT THE PROPOSED EXCAVATION. THE OPERATOR LOCATES AND MARKS ON THE ROADWAY THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF INSTALLATIONS THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE EXCAVATION, BUT IS NOT REQUIRED TO MARK DEPTH UNDER THE STATUTE. THE EXCAVATOR MUST THEN USE HAND TOOLS TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE INSTALLATION. HERE, HG RESPONDED TO THE TICKET BY REVIEWING MAPS, PERFORMING TONING AND MARKING THE ALIGNMENT--BUT NOT DEPTH--OF THE GAS MAIN IN THE EXCAVATION AREA WITH YELLOW PAINT. HG WAS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE ONE CALL STATUTE. RB DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HAND EXCAVATED AND LOCATED THE SUBJECT SEGMENT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE.    (2) SUBJECT SEGMENT DEPTH    FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN 1977 REQUIRED 24-INCH COVER FOR A MAIN LINE. A MAIN LINE CAN BE INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER IF AN UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE PREVENTS SUCH INSTALLATION AND THE LINE IS PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL PROTECTION. ON 06/16/2015, THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS MEASURED AT APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES BELOW THE ROADWAY SURFACE. IF THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER IN 1977, THE ABOVE EXCEPTION APPLIES. CITY RECORDS INDICATE THAT A CONDUIT STRUCTURE RUNS DIRECTLY BELOW THE SUBJECT SEGMENT, PREVENTING INSTALLATION OF THE SUBJECT SEGMENT AT 24-INCH DEPTH.

THE GROUND WAS FROZEN, WITH FROST EXTENDING 2-4 FEET BELOW THE SURFACE, AND THE MAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET DEEP AT THIS LOCATION.  DURING THE EXCAVATION, AT APPROXIMATELY 0554, A SECONDARY IGNITION OCCURRED AT 1215 LILAC LANE.  THE ENSUING FIRE DAMAGED THE HOMES AT 1211, 1213, 1215, AND 1217 LILAC LANE.  CREWS SHUT DOWN THE MAIN ON LILAC LANE BY STOPPING GAS FLOW TO THE THREE TIE-IN POINTS THAT FED THE STREET.  CREWS DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS A 1 1/4 INCH STEEL MAIN THAT HAD SEPARATED AT A WELD JOINT.  CREWS REPAIRED THE BROKEN MAIN AND RESTORED SERVICE TO NON-AFFECTED HOMES AT APPROXIMATELY 1800. THROUGHOUT THE DAY, ADDITIONAL ENSTAR CREWS WERE CALLED IN FROM THE KENAI AND ANCHORAGE AREAS TO SUPPORT THE RESPONSE.

THE ROOT CAUSE WAS OVERPRESSURIZATION OF THE GAS SERVICE  REGULATOR SUPPLYING COOKING LOADS TO 152 APARTMENTS, DUE TO IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE VENT LINES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL INSTALLATION.  THIS WAS A PARALLEL GAS SERVICE REGULATOR INSTALLATION. PART OF THE VENT LINES WERE INSTALLED BELOW GRADE, PASSING THROUGH TWO CONCRETE BARRIERS:  ONE AT FOUNDATION WALL, AND ONE AT SIDEWALK.  THESE VENT LINES WERE BOTH UNSLEEVED, AND CORRODED OVER TIME.  WATER FROM THE SURROUNDING SOIL INFILTRATED THE VENT LINE AND COLLECTED ON TOP OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR DIAPHRAGM AND FROZE. IN ADDITION, THE VENT LINE WAS PARTIALLY FROZEN AND BLOCKED. THE SECONDARY REGULATOR SERVED TO VENT EXCESS GAS DUE TO ELEVATED PRESSURE. A SERVICE PERSON RESPONDING TO A CALL AT THIS LOCATION FOUND THE COUPLING ON THE SECONDARY VENT LINE DISCONNECTED, AND OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, ""VALVED OUT"" THE SECONDARY REGULATOR TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOWING GAS.  THIS PREVENTED THE INTERNAL RELIEF OF THE SECONDARY GAS SERVICE REGULATOR TO VENT THE EXCESS PRESSURE FROM THE FAILED REGULATOR; THEREFORE BOTH RELIEF VALVES WERE RENDERED INEFFECTIVE, ALLOWING DOWNSTREAM PRESSURE TO BUILD UP TO LEVELS BEYOND RECOMMENDED LIMITS FOR THE CUSTOMERS' EQUIPMENT AND A FIRE RESULTED IN ONE OF THE APARTMENTS.  COOKING LOADS FOR ALL 152 APARTMENTS REMAIN TURNED OFF UNTIL THE ASSIGNED PLUMBER OBTAINS THE PERMIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS.

PGW RESPONDED TO INVESTIGATE THE AREA AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS A RUSTED OUT STEEL SERVICE PIPE IN THE FOOTWAY. PGW DISCONNECTED THE SERVICE ADJACENT TO THE MAIN CONNECTION AND INSERTED PLASTIC TO THE FRONT WALL OF THE PROPERTY IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE LEAK AND RESTORE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  THE SERVICE CONNECTION TO THE MAIN WAS A STEEL NIPPLE COMING OFF THE SIDE OF A 6' LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN. THIS MAIN CONNECTION REQUIRED THE SERVICES OF A WELDER IN ORDER TO BE PERMANENTLY ABANDONED AND REPLACED WITH A NEW SERVICE TEE.  THE STEEL SERVICE CONNECTION WAS TEMPORARILY WRAPPED WITH WAX-TAPE AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE AND LEFT OVERNIGHT UNTIL A WELDER WAS AVAILABLE.     ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12TH, 2017, PGW DISPATCHED A MAINTENANCE CREW AND WELDER TO THE SITE TO ABANDON THE STEEL NIPPLE SERVICE CONNECTION AND INSTALL A NEW SERVICE TEE.

THE WELDER ATTEMPTED TO WELD THE PLUG SHUT AND IGNITED A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS WHICH HE WAS UNAWARE WAS BYPASSING.  THE WELDER THEN ATTEMPTED TO ADJUST THE PLUG WITH A PIPE WRENCH INSTEAD OF EXTINGUISHING THE FLAME.  DURING THIS PROCESS, THE PLUG EVACUATED THE OPENING IN THE MAIN AND ALLOWED THE GAS FROM THE MAIN TO ESCAPE AND MAKE CONTACT WITH THE PREVIOUSLY IGNITED FLAME. WHILE HIS FR CLOTHING AND SAFETY GLASSES PROTECTED HIS UPPER TORSO AND EYES, THE PGW WELDER SUSTAINED BURNS TO HIS FACE AND NECK AND WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BY THE PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT.

AS DESCRIBED IN THE DOCUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE PUBLIC DOCKET, THE NTSB FOUND THAT THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS AT MINNEHAHA ACADEMY OCCURRED WHEN MASTER MECHANICAL DISASSEMBLED EXISTING PIPING IN THE ACADEMY'S BOILER ROOM.  THE MASTER MECHANICAL PERSONNEL BELIEVED A 3-INCH WALWORTH PLUG VALVE UPSTREAM OF THE DISASSEMBLED EXISTING PIPING WAS IN THE CLOSED POSITION ON THE DAY OF THE EXPLOSION, WHEN IN FACT IT WAS OPEN.  THE NTSB ALSO PERFORMED A POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE TAKEN FROM THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION AND FOUND THAT INDICATORS ON THE 3-INCH WALWORTH PLUG VALVE CONFIRMED THAT THE VALVE'S ORIENTATION WAS IN THE OPEN POSITION.  THE NTSB ALSO NOTED THAT ""CONFIRMATION OF WHETHER THE VALVE IS OPEN OR CLOSED IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CREW WORKING ON THE PIPING.  THIS CONFIRMATION WOULD ENTAIL REMOVAL OF THE HANDLE AND NOTING THE POSITION OF THE PLUG ASSEMBLY.""  THE MASTER MECHANICAL PERSONNEL DID NOT PERFORM EITHER OF THESE FUNCTIONS TO CONFIRM THE ORIENTATION OF THE VALVE ON THE DAY OF THE EXPLOSION. AS NOTED IN PARD D 2A OF THIS REPORT, THE EXPLOSION CAUSED AN ESTIMATED $48 MILLION IN ""PROPERTY DAMAGE"" (AS DEFINED IN PHMSA F7100.1) TO THE SCHOOL. THIS FIGURE IS BASED ON ESTIMATES FROM THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL'S PROPERTY INSURER.    IN ITS DECEMBER 6, 2019 ACCIDENT BRIEF, THE NTSB STATED THAT ""THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE NATURAL GAS EXPLOSION AT THE MINNEHAHA ACADEMY WAS THE DISASSEMBLING OF PIPING UPSTREAM OF A GAS SERVICE METER IN THE BUILDING BY A PIPEFITTING CREW [MASTER MECHANICAL], RESULTING IN THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY IGNITED.

MULTIPLE 911 CALLS CAME INTO THE DALLAS FIRE-RESCUE DISPATCH CENTER REPORTING THE EXPLOSION.  FIVE FAMILY MEMBERS WERE IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  ONE RESIDENT'S INJURIES WERE FATAL. THE OTHER FOUR RESIDENTS SUSTAINED NON-LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.    AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, ATMOS PERSONNEL WERE IN THE AREA WORKING TO REPAIR A NON-HAZARDOUS LEAK IN THE 3500 BLOCK OF ESPANOLA. AN ATMOS OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR HEARD THE EXPLOSION AND TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PROTECT LIVES AND MAKE THE AREA SAFE.  HE DIRECTED HIS CREW TO START EVACUATING A TWO-BLOCK AREA, NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ACCIDENT HOUSE.  FIREFIGHTERS AND ATMOS CREWS WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR ADVISING RESIDENTS TO EVACUATE AND TO REFRAIN FROM STARTING CARS OR SWITCHING ON LIGHTS.  THE EVACUATION WAS COMPLETED IN 12-15 MINUTES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF DALLAS FIRE-RESCUE.  THE ATMOS ONSITE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR, WORKING WITH THE OPERATIONS MANAGER AND THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS, COORDINATED THE SHUT-DOWN OF THE MAIN LINE IN THE ALLEY BEHIND 3534 ESPANOLA.     THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) ARRIVED ONSITE ON 2/25/2018. ATMOS ENERGY, THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION (RRC), PIPELINE & HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (PHMSA), AND DALLAS FIRE - RESCUE ASSISTED WITH THE NTSB'S INVESTIGATION.       THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AT 3534 ESPANOLA DRIVE WAS THE IGNITION OF AN ACCUMULATION OF NATURAL GAS THAT LEAKED FROM THE GAS MAIN THAT WAS DAMAGED DURING A SEWER REPLACEMENT PROJECT 23 YEARS EARLIER.

COLUMBIA'S SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED AT 12:42 AM AND ARRIVED ON SITE AT 01:15 AM AND FOUND THAT GAS HAD BEEN SHUT OFF AT THE METER VALVE BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. ADDITIONAL COLUMBIA RESOURCES ARRIVED ON SITE AT 1:50 AM TO ASSIST IN THE RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT. COLUMBIA EMPLOYEES SET UP A PERIMETER AND EVACUATED THE NEIGHBORING HOME AT 605 FLEMING FALLS WHERE NATURAL GAS READINGS WERE DISCOVERED IN THE BASEMENT. COLUMBIA VERIFIED THAT THE SYSTEM PRESSURE WAS WITHIN THE MAOP ESTABLISHED FOR THAT SYSTEM AND THAT ODORANT WAS COMPLIANT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. ELECTRIC METERS WERE REMOVED TO ELIMINATE SOURCES OF IGNITION AND COLUMBIA BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR LEAKAGE AND ENSURE SAFETY.    THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RAIN  THAT CAUSED THE SANITARY LIFT PUMPS TO FAIL  AND MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY PUSHED A SLUG OF SEWER GAS  INTO THE BASEMENT VIA FLOOR DRAINS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE TIED DIRECTLY TO THE SANITARY SEWER FOR 605 AND 613 FLEMING FALLS RD. THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED APPEARS TO BE A LOW LEVEL EXPLOSION. COLUMBIA LOCATED AND REPAIRED A TOTAL OF FOUR LEAKS OF WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE NON-CAUSAL. THE CLOSEST BEING APPROXIMATELY 290' AWAY AND THE FURTHEST BEING APPROXIMATELY 1300' AWAY FROM THE INCIDENT. THE SURFACE LEVEL OF THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET IS APPROXIMATELY 12'  LOWER THAN THE SURFACE LEVEL OF THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE INCIDENT SITE.  COLUMBIA CREATED A TEMPORARY BYPASS TO KEEP CUSTOMERS IN SERVICE, ABANDONING APPROXIMATELY 775' OF BARE STEEL HIGH PRESSURE MAINLINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET.    COLUMBIA PRESSURE TESTED THE BARE STEEL MAIN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET ALONG WITH THE SERVICES (WITH NO DROP IN PRESSURE AT 76 PSIG) AND RAN A CAMERA INSIDE THEM TO ENSURE ALL SERVICE TEES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND TO LOOK FOR ANOMALIES. COLUMBIA TESTED APPROXIMATELY 448' OF HIGH DENSITY POLY ETHYLENE (HDPE) MAIN LINE AND 6 SERVICES ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND IT SUCCESSFULLY PASSED SEVERAL PRESSURE TESTS AT 76 PSIG (OPERATING PRESSURE), 15 INCHES WATER COLUMN AND 150 PSIG. IN ADDITION COLUMBIA TESTED APPROXIMATELY 1,175' OF HDPE MAIN LINE AND SERVICE ON THE STREET BEHIND INCIDENT SITE. AT 613 FLEMING FALLS RD., COLUMBIA PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE AND CHECKED THE SERVICE REGULATOR FOR LOCK UP AND FLOW WITHOUT ISSUE AND NO LEAKAGE DETECTED. THE SERVICE LINE AT THE NEIGHBORING HOME (637  FLEMING FALLS RD) WAS ALSO TESTED AND FOUND TO BE LEAK FREE. COLUMBIA DID EXPLORATORY EXCAVATION AROUND THE AREA TO ENSURE CONDUITS DID NOT EXIST THAT COULD CONVEY MIGRATING GAS. COLUMBIA ALSO RAN A CAMERA IN THE SANITARY MAIN AND SEWER LATERALS TO ENSURE THAT A CROSS BORE DID NOT EXIST. UN-COLLAPSED STORM SEWERS WERE VIDEOED AS WELL TO ENSURE A CROSS BORE DID NOT EXIST.     COLUMBIA WORKED WITH THE PUCO, STATE FIRE MARSHALL, A THIRD-PARTY CAUSE AND ORIGIN SPECIALIST, AND A GEOLOGIST TO DETERMINE A CAUSE. LABORATORY GAS ANALYSES AND OUR GEOLOGIST'S INTERPRETATION INDICATE THAT THE STRAY GAS SAMPLES HAD A COMPARABLE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION AND MOLECULAR PROFILE, AND IS SIMILAR IN ORIGIN TO COLUMBIA'S PIPELINE GAS, HOWEVER, NATURALLY OCCURRING METHANE CONTAINING SIMILAR MOLECULAR AND ISOTOPIC PROFILE CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE. THE GEOLOGIST THEORIZES THAT GROUND WATER, IN COMBINATION WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF RAIN WATER, LIKELY CREATED CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR GAS MIGRATION TOWARD THE STRUCTURES AT 605 AND 613 FLEMING FALLS RD.     COLUMBIA HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT CANNOT BE FULLY ASCERTAINED. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS REPORT A FINAL REPORT.

THE GAS MIGRATED INTO THE BASEMENT OF THE INCIDENT HOUSE WHERE IT FOUND AN IGNITION SOURCE, MOST LIKELY THE HOUSE FURNACE.

A MALE OCCUPANT WAS INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION AND TRANSPORTED TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL.  THE HOME WAS A COMPLETE LOSS WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $59,400.    PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, AT APPROXIMATELY 21:45 HOURS CONSUMERS ENERGY RECEIVED AND RESPONDED TO AN OUTSIDE LEAK INVESTIGATION AT 443 SOUTH BOULEVARD, PONTIAC, MI.  THE GAS SERVICE WORKER (GSW) ARRIVED ONSITE AT APPROXIMATELY 22:18, HEARD BLOWING GAS AT/NEAR THE SERVICE TEE AND REQUESTED A DISTRIBUTION CREW. THE GSW ALSO OBTAINED 6% FREE AIR READS AT THE PROPERTY ENTRANCE AND ADVISED THE OCCUPANTS NOT TO RE-ENTER THE HOME.      WHILE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THE AREA, THE GSW HEARD WHAT HE BELIEVED MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSION NEARBY (APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET FROM THE SOUTH BLVD. LOCATION) AND NOTIFIED HIS FIELD LEADER.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE AREA DETERMINED GAS READS (APPROXIMATELY 55% GAS) IN THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 73 FEET WEST OF THE SEWER LEAD SERVING 406 IRWIN AVE.  GAS READS WERE ALSO OBTAINED AT 398 IRWIN AVE. RESULTING IN AN EVACUATION OF THE OCCUPANT AT THIS PROPERTY. (FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION, THE SEWER LEAD FOR 406 IRWIN AVENUE WAS LATER DETERMINED TO BE SOUTH OF THE SANITARY SEWER LOCATED AT THE INTERSECTION OF GOING STREET AND IRWIN AVENUE)    THE DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED ON FEBRUARY 3, 2019 AT APPROXIMATELY 00:35 HOURS.  THE SOURCE OF THE BLOWING GAS WAS DETERMINED TO BE A LEAK ON THE 3/4 INCH PIPE THREAD THAT TIED INTO THE HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE SERVICE LINE, REGULATOR AND SECURITY WERE REPLACED AND GAS READS BEGAN TO DISSIPATE FROM THE SANITARY SEWER.    ON FEBRUARY 20, 2019 THE INTERESTED PARTIES MET ON-SCENE TO CONDUCT A JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION.  THE PARTIES AGREED THE CURRENT WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROPERTY MADE IT UNSAFE TO PROCEED FORWARD WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  THE JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION WAS POSTPONED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 DAYS.    UNTIL A FULL ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION CAN BE COMPLETED THE CAUSE AND ORIGIN REMAINS CLASSIFIED AS UNDETERMINED.      ON MARCH 25, 2019 A JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED, THE LOCATION WAS CAREFULLY EXCAVATED AND ALL GAS APPLIANCES WERE REMOVED AND TRANSPORTED TO THE SAFETY ENGINEERING LABORATORIES, INC. (SEL) FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATION AND TESTING.    THE FOLLOWING DAY, MARCH 26, 2019 DESTRUCTIVE TESTING FOR THE FAILURE THAT OCCURRED ON THE BURIED REGULATOR LOCATED AT 443 SOUTH BOULEVARD WAS PERFORMED AT THE CONSUMERS ENERGY TRAIL STREET LABORATORY.      ON APRIL 10, 2019 A JOINT SCENE EXAM WAS HELD WITH CONSUMERS ENERGY, SEL AND THE MPSC.  THE BASEMENT OF THE RESIDENCE WAS EXCAVATED AND WATER DRAINED IN THE ATTEMPT TO LOCATE, TRACE AND VIDEO (PHOTOGRAPH) THE SEWER LINE FROM THE INSIDE OF THE HOME TO THE SANITARY SEWER UNDER THE ROADWAY.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION, A HOLE (APPROXIMATELY 4X4) CUT INTO THE TOP OF THE METAL SEWER LINE IN THE BASEMENT BEFORE THE SEWER TRAP WAS DISCOVERED.

ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT INDICATES THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF AXIAL BENDING STRESSES ON THE PIPE STRING, LIKELY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A CAVERN OR VOID IN THE ROCK FORMATION THROUGH WHICH THE AUGER PASSED, WHICH CAUSED THE AUGER TO VEER OFF COURSE. THE BENDING STRESS CAUSED THE FIELD GIRTH WELD LOCATED AT THE EDGE OF THE CAVERN TO FAIL, PRIMARILY IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD.

PGW IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED FIRST RESPONDERS TO INVESTIGATE. THE FIRST PGW EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 11:49 AM. UPON ARRIVAL THREE PROPERTIES WERE ON FIRE (1433, 1435, & 1437 S. 8TH STREET) AND THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS CONSISTENT WITH A POTENTIAL EXPLOSION. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE PFD, PGW  PERFORMED HOUSE CHECKS AND THE PFD EVACUATED APPROXIMATELY 60 PEOPLE DURING THE EVENT.     A 6"" CAST IRON GAS MAIN SUPPLIED THE GAS SERVICES TO THE PROPERTIES ON FIRE. IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN THE GAS MAIN AND SERVICES TO THESE PROPERTIES PGW UTILIZED GREASE INJECTED THROUGH THE SERVICES OF 1421 AND 1441 S. 8TH STREET. THE MAIN AND SERVICES WERE SHUT DOWN AT 13:27. THE PERMANENT CUT AND CAPS OF THE 6"" CAST IRON MAIN WERE COMPLETED AT 17:30.     ON 12/19/19 AT 23:00 PGW INSERTED A CAMERA INSIDE THE ABANDONED 6"" CAST IRON GAS MAIN AND IDENTIFIED A POTENTIAL BROKEN MAIN LOCATION. THE CAMERA VIEW WAS HINDERED DUE TO THE MAIN BEING FILLED WITH WATER. ON 12/21/19 (AFTER THE WATER HAD BEEN DRAINED FROM THE MAIN) PGW INSERTED THE CAMERA AGAIN AND IDENTIFIED A CLEAR CIRCUMFERENTIAL BREAK WHERE THE MAIN HAD DROPPED. THE LOCATION OF THE BROKEN MAIN WAS 136 FEET NNCL OF DICKINSON STREET.     ON 12/22/19 PGW WAS GIVEN ACCESS TO EXCAVATE AND RETRIEVE THE 6"" CAST IRON BROKEN MAIN FOR EVIDENCE. THE FOOTWAY AND ROADWAY PAVEMENT WAS UNDERMINED AT THIS LOCATION AND A LARGE CAVITY EXISTED IN THE INTERSECTION OF 1400 S. 8TH STREET AND 800 WILDER STREET.  A 6"" STAINLESS STEEL SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED ON THE BROKEN MAIN AND THIS SECTION OF MAIN WAS MARKED AND REMOVED FOR EVIDENCE.     THE TESTING AND METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED DUE TO THE CURRENT WORK STOPPAGE CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE TESTING WILL BE RESCHEDULED AFTER THE PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED.

THE FOUR NEIGHBORING HOMES, ALONG WITH 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE, WERE ALL EVACUATED (I.E., 1345, 1347, 1349, 1401, 1403 COURTLAND DRIVE). THE RESIDENTS OF 1401 AND 1403 COURTLAND DRIVE WERE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES WITHIN DAYS OF THE INCIDENT. AS OF AUGUST 2020, ALL RESIDENTS OF 1345 AND 1349 COURTLAND DRIVE HAD RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES. THE HOME AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE SUSTAINED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND IS NOT HABITABLE.    WHILE THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN AND CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS ONGOING, A NATURAL GAS LEAK WAS OBSERVED NEAR THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE STEEL TAPPING TEE AND THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE THAT SERVED 1345 COURTLAND DRIVE.  THE RESPONDING DENC CREW STOPPED THE LEAK BY RUNNING THE TAPPING TEE CUTTER DOWN.  AS A PRECAUTION, THE TAPPING TEE AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE WAS ALSO SHUT OFF BY RUNNING DOWN THE TAPPING TEE PERFORATOR/STOP FOR THE SERVICE LINE.  BOTH SERVICES WERE LATER DISCONNECTED, AND STEEL CAPS WERE WELDED ON.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE MAIN IN FRONT OF 1345, 1347 AND 1349 COURTLAND DRIVE WAS EXPOSED AND VERIFIED THERE WERE NO LEAKS.      A PORTION OF THE STEEL TAPPING TEE AND PLASTIC SERVICE LINE TO 1345 COURTLAND DRIVE WITH THE VERIFIED LEAK WAS REMOVED AND PRESERVED FOR FURTHER TESTING. A LEAK FLOW TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE SUBJECT PIPE IN A LABORATORY SETTING ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020, USING COMPRESSED AIR. AT 59.0 PSI, THE LEAK RATE WAS 72 SCFH OF AIR. THIS CONVERTS TO APPROXIMATELY 97.3 SCFH OF NATURAL GAS. USING THIS LEAK RATE, DENC CAN MORE ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF LOST GAS AT 322.26 MCF, AS NOTED IN PART A.7. THE LOST GAS COST ESTIMATE CAN ALSO BE UPDATED TO $1,495, AS NOTED IN PART D.2F.    DENC RETAINED INVESTIGATORS WHO EXAMINED THE SCENE.  THESE INVESTIGATORS OBSERVED OXY-ACETYLENE TANKS LAYING ON THEIR SIDE IN THE CRAWL SPACE OF 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE INVESTIGATORS ASSESSED BLAST DYNAMICS AND OBSERVED ISOLATED BURN DAMAGE. SPECIFICALLY, THEY FOUND LITTLE TO NO FLAME PROPAGATION. THE PHOTOGRAPHS AFTER THE EXPLOSION DEMONSTRATE THAT NEITHER THE WOOD JOISTS IN THE CRAWL SPACE NOR THE FOAM INSULATION WERE BURNED. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST IGNITION OF A DISCRETE AMOUNT OF GASEOUS FUEL. HOWEVER, THE EXACT AMOUNT OF GAS THAT WAS CONSUMED IN THE EXPLOSION IS NOT YET DETERMINED. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF GAS CONSUMED IN THE EXPLOSION IS LESS THAN 1 MCF. (NOTE: REPORT PART A.21C WILL ONLY ALLOW A MINIMUM OF 1 MCF TO BE ENTERED.)    IN LIGHT OF THE PHYSICAL FINDINGS, INVESTIGATORS QUESTIONED WHETHER OTHER POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS MAY HAVE LED TO THIS EXPLOSION. SPECIFICALLY, THE OXY-ACETYLENE TANKS, WHICH WERE LOCATED IN THE CRAWL SPACE WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS FIRST ARRIVED ON SCENE AND APPARENTLY IN USE BY THE HOMEOWNER'S HVAC CONTRACTOR AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT, BUT LATER WENT MISSING AS OF AUGUST 8, 2020, AND HAVE NOT BEEN RECOVERED AS OF THE SUBMISSION DATE OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.

SOUTHWEST GAS CREWS ARRIVED AT 09:35 PDT AND OBTAINED GAS READS OF 4 LEL BY THE RISER TO THE LAUNDRY FACILITY, TURNED OFF THE METER, CONFIRMED ZERO GAS READS INSIDE THE UNOCCUPIED BUILDING, AND CONDUCTED FURTHER LEAK INVESTIGATION.  AT 10:13 PDT, IGNITION OF FUGITIVE NATURAL GAS OCCURRED WITHIN THE DETACHED, UNOCCUPIED LAUNDRY FACILITY STRUCTURE RESULTING IN A FIRE AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.  POST IGNITION LEAK SURVEY RESULTS DISCOVERED INCREASING GAS READINGS AND LEAK SPREAD RESULTING IN AN EVACUATION OF 14 PEOPLE FROM SOME UNITS OF THE ADJACENT, SEPARATE APARTMENT BUILDING. A LEAK ON A PVC SERVICE LINE COUPLING CONNECTION FITTING WAS REVEALED DURING A LEAK TEST OF THE PVC SERVICE DURING A POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. ADDITIONALLY, A LEAK TEST PERFORMED ON THE CUSTOMER'S HOUSELINE FAILED DURING THE POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION.     PART A4: BASED ON COMMUNICATIONS THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF NEVADA'S REGULATORY OPERATIONS STAFF HAD WITH THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION DIVISION, ""LOCAL TIME AND DATE OF THE INCIDENT"" REFLECTS THE TIME SOUTHWEST GAS WAS NOTIFIED OF A LEAK ON THE PIPELINE.  AT THAT TIME, NO INCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA WAS MET.     PART A6:  SOUTHWEST GAS NOTIFIED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) TELEPHONICALLY OF THE INCIDENT ON JUNE 24, 2020 AT 14:33 PDT.  THE NRC ISSUED REPORT NUMBER 1280311 FOR THE INCIDENT.  SOUTHWEST GAS PROVIDED A 48-HOUR UPDATE TELEPHONICALLY TO THE NRC ON JUNE 25, 2020 AT 15:28 PDT. THE NRC ISSUED REPORT NUMBER 1280402 FOR THE UPDATED REPORT.    SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:     CHANGED PART G TO UPDATE THE APPARENT CAUSE FROM PART G5 TO G8. THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION. CURRENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE CAUSE MAY BE G3, G4, OR G5.  THE SAMPLE HAS BEEN SENT TO A THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS TESTING LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS AND THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS WILL BE PROVIDED IN A SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE. THE LEAK WAS ORIGINALLY BELIEVED TO BE DUE TO A SOLVENT CEMENT JOINT, BUT A CRACK WAS FOUND WHEN ASSESSED IN SOUTHWEST GAS'S MATERIALS TESTING LABORATORY. THE CRACK APPEARS TO BE A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK IN THE PIPE NEAR THE LOCATION OF THE PIPE TO COUPLING JOINT.     SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE 2:    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, THE SERVICE LINE WAS DISCONNECTED AT THE MAIN.  ON MARCH 30, 2021, THE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER WAS REPLACED.    PART C, 3 AND 4 - CHANGED THE PIPE SIZE AND WALL THICKNESS TO 0.5-INCH AND 0.109-INCH RESPECTIVELY BASED ON 3RD PARTY LABORATORY ANALYSIS.    CHANGED PART G FROM G8 - OTHER INCIDENT CAUSE TO G4 - OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE, WITH A SUB-CAUSE AS OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE.  AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY'S MATERIAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS SUSTAINED EXTERNAL BENDING LOADS LEADING TO SLOW CRACK GROWTH AND CREEP RUPTURE.

VALVES ON THE 2"" MAIN, IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE DAMAGED 4"" MAIN, WERE NOTED BY GAS FIRST RESPONSE PERSONNEL AS REQUIRING EXCAVATION TO OPERATE.  BECAUSE OF THE GAS READS IN THE AREA, SQUEEZE LOCATIONS ON THE 2"" MAIN FURTHER FROM THE DAMAGED 4"" WERE SELECTED AS ALTERNATES TO EXCAVATING AND OPERATING THE VALVES.  SQUEEZING OF THE 4"" PE MAIN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE DAMAGE WAS NOT FEASIBLE AS THE DEPTH OF MAIN WAS DETERMINED TO BE 6 TO 7 FEET DEEP.  INSTEAD, MULTIPLE VALVE CLOSURES WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE ISOLATION PLAN.

AT THIS TIME, THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY WERE STILL SHUT OFF TO THE HOUSE AND THE ELECTRIC METER HAD TO BE RE-INSTALLED.  AFTER TURNING THE ELECTRICITY BACK ON THE HOMEOWNER REPORTED POPPING NOISES COMING FROM THE FURNACE.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN CHECKED NEAR THE FURNACE AND FOUND 0% LEL AND DECIDED TO TURN THE FURNACE OFF AT THE THERMOSTAT.  WHILE ENTERING THE HOUSE FROM THE GARAGE, THE GAS SERVICEMAN SAW A RED GLOW ABOVE HIS HEAD WHICH WAS AN IGNITION OF GAS AT APPROXIMATELY 12:46 P.M. PDT.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN EXITED THROUGH THE OPEN GARAGE DOOR AND THE MALE HOMEOWNER EXITED THROUGH THE REAR GARAGE ACCESS DOOR.
