SNG FIELD PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO CLOSE VALVES FOR ISOLATION OF THE FAILURE SITE AND TAKE THE AFFECTED SEGMENT OF PIPELINE OUT OF SERVICE.

FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES, AND CONDITIONS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO CAUSING THE INCIDENT    THE LEAK WAS THE RESULT OF A THOUGH-WALL CRACK IN THE GIRTH WELD JOINING THE 1.000' WT INDUCTION BEND TO 0.600' WT PIPE TRANSITION PIPE.     THE CRACK WAS THE RESULT OF HYDROGEN-ASSISTED CRACKING (HAC).

MARGINAL HEAT INPUT WAS LIKELY THE RESULT OF COLD AND WINDY CONDITIONS PRESENT DURING THE DAY OF WELDING. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF CRACKING ELSEWHERE IN THE WELD.     THE CRACK OCCURRED ON THE FACTORY END OF AN INDUCTION BEND AT A LOCATION WITH OPTIMUM WELD FIT-UP. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT WELD FIT-UP DID NOT PLAY ANY ROLE IN THE INITIATION OF THE HYDROGEN CRACK.

A FIRE WAS DISCOVERED, BY A NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY EMPLOYEE, AT THE REDFIELD UNDERGROUND STORAGE FIELD, LOCATED NEAR REDFIELD, IOWA, IN THE SL PETER UNDERGROUND STORAGE FORMATION AT WHAT IS CALLED THE MAHER #3  WELL SITE IN SECTION 12, T19N, R29W, DALLAS COUNTY, IOWA. THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION, NO INJURIES, NO EVACUATIONS AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS.     AT APPROXIMATELY 24:00 HOURS THE ST PETER FORMATION PIPELINE SYSTEM PORTION, OF THE STORAGE FIELD, WAS ISOLATED AND PRESSURE WAS BLOWN DOWN ON THE PIPING TO 5 PSIG TO ENABLE SAFE CLOSURE OF THE MAHER #3 WELL HEAD VALVE (SEE PAGE 2, ITEM 15A). THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY 01:50 A.M. THE FIRE DESTROYED THE WELL HOUSE BUILDING AND ALL OF THE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE BUILDING BUT THE WELL HEAD VALVE AND PIPING WERE UNAFFECTED. THE PORTION OF THE ST. PETER PIPING, THAT WAS ISOLATED IN ORDER TO FACILITATE REDUCTION IN PRESSURE FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE MAHER #3 WELL HEAD VALVE, WAS RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION PRESSURES AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00 A.M. ON MONDAY, JANUARY 11TH (SEE PAGE 2, ITEM 15B).    PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THAT THE GAS LEAKAGE APPEARED TO BE FROM A BROKEN ONE-INCH UNION ON THE WELL SEPARATOR DRAIN LINE. THE UNION'S THREADS APPEARED TO BE STRIPPED OR PULLED. AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE WAS 21 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND THE WIND WAS OUT OF THE WEST AT APPROXIMATELY 14 MILES PER HOUR. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FREEZING AND HEAVING MAY HAVE CREATING SUFFICIENT THERMAL STRESS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEPARATION OF THE THREADS ON THE ONE-INCH UNION. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE FAILURE THERE WAS AN APPROXIMATE LOW TEMPERATURE OF - 19 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN THE AREA. ADDITIONAL METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS IS BEING CONDUCTED TO ASSIST WITH DETERMINING WHETHER THERMAL STRESS FROM THE COLD TEMPERATURES COULD BE A ROOT CAUSE FOR STRIPPING OF THE THREADS AND THE UNION'S FAILURE.    FINAL REPORT: A METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE FAILED ONE-INCH UNION INDICATED THAT TWO PORTIONS OF THE UNION'S THREADS DEMONSTRATED ROLLED DAMAGE TO THE TOP OF THE THREADS, WHICH INDICATES THE COMPONENT PULLED OVER THE PEAK OF THE THREAD AS IT DISENGAGED. AN EXAMINATION OF THE THREADS ALSO INDICATES ONE FLATTENED/ROUNDED LOCATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED OR IMPROPERLY MACHINED PREVIOUS TO THE FAILURE. THE FITTING WAS INSTALLED IN 2006, AND MAY HAVE BEEN FAULTY AND THE FROZEN CONDITION OF THE DRAIN LINE, ON DECEMBER 10, 2010, MOST LIKELY CREATED THERMAL STRESS, WHICH RESULTED IN FAILURE OF THE FITTING. AS A MEASURE TO PREVENT RECURRENCE, ALL WELL SEPARATOR DRAIN LINES AT THE REDFIELD, IOWA UNDERGROUND STORAGE FACILITY WERE DISSEMBLED AND INSPECTED. NO OTHER ISSUES OR PROBLEMS WERE FOUND. THE FIRE APPEARS TO HAVE STARTED IMMEDIATELY AS THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF AN EXPLOSION. THE WIRING IN THE CONDUIT, STATIC ELECTRICITY OR SPARKS FROM THE BUILDING STRUCTURE OR THE ONE-INCH PIPE STRIKING OTHER PIPING WHEN IT SEPARATED WAS THE LIKELY IGNITION SOURCE. THIS EVENT IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE AND CLOSED.   SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL TO REPORT 20100019 PER PHMSA REQUEST IDENTIFIED PART E5F AS TRANSMISSION."

A SHORT SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 12-18 INCHES) OF A 16 INCH RECYCLE PIPING SYSTEM WAS TO BE REMOVED AND A 16 X 8 REDUCING TEE ADDED TO CONNECT A NEW RECYCLE PIPING SYSTEM TO THE EXISTING RECYCLE PIPING SYSTEM.  A LOCK-OUT/TAG-OUT PROCEDURE AND AN AIR MOVER WERE IN PLACE TO ELIMINATE OR MITIGATE HAZARDS DURING THE HOT WORK OPERATION.    MEANWHILE, WORKERS WERE INSTALLING A NEW METER TUBE ON AN ADJACENT PIPING MANIFOLD THAT WAS CONNECTED TO THE RECYCLE PIPING SYSTEM.    A 12"" BLIND FLANGE WAS REMOVED FROM THE PIPING MANIFOLD TO INSTALL AN ISOLATION VALVE BETWEEN THE NEW METER TUBE AND THE EXISTING PIPING MANIFOLD.  A CONTRACT EMPLOYEE WAS STANDING BESIDE THE OPEN ENDED PIPE FLANGE AT THE SAME TIME THE NEARBY HOT WORK IGNITED VAPORS INSIDE THE PIPING SYSTEM.  CONTRACT EMPLOYEE WAS INJURED AS A RESULT OF A FLASH FIRE WHICH IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED ITSELF.  CONTRACT EMPLOYEE'S INJURIES REQUIRED IN-PATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.      UPDATE NOVEMBER 23, 2010  AN INVESTIGATION TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OR CAUSES OF THE INCIDENT.  THE FOLLOWING CAUSAL FACTORS WERE IDENTIFIED:     1. TWO INDEPENDENT JOBS WERE ON-GOING AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IMPACTED ONE ANOTHER AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THESE JOBS  WAS NOT ADEQUATE TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF INDEPENDENT ACTIONS TAKEN.  2. THREE VALVES (XV #853, XV # 861, AND XV # 871) FAILED OPEN WHEN THE INSTRUMENT AIR BLED OFF FOLLOWING THE INITIAL ESD.  THIS CONDITION MAY HAVE UNKNOWINGLY INCREASED THE VOLUME OF VAPORS WITHIN THE PIPING REQUIRED TO BE PURGED PRIOR TO THE HOT WORK BEING CONDUCTED THEREBY DECREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AIR MOVER.    3. A12-INCH BLIND FLANGE WAS REMOVED, POTENTIALLY CHANGING THE AIR FLOW DYNAMICS WITHIN THE PIPE AND POSSIBLY LIMITING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AIR MOVER IN THE LOCATION OF THE 16-INCH TEE ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE EXISTING RECYCLE METER RUN.  4. THE SCOPE OF THE SAFE WORK PERMIT (WRITTEN PRIOR TO WORK BEING PERFORMED), WHICH INCLUDED MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS OVER AN ENTIRE SHIFT, WAS LIKELY TOO BROAD TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING MULTIPLE TASKS.    THE FOLLOWING ROOT CAUSE(S) WERE IDENTIFIED:    1. THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE ONGOING AND SEEMINGLY UNRELATED JOBS WITHIN THE SAME GENERAL WORK AREA WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ANALYZED TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF ONE JOB ON THE OTHER.  2. THREE VALVES THAT WERE CLOSED DURING LO/TO FAILED OPEN DUE TO THE LOSS OF INSTRUMENT GAS AFTER THE ESD.  THIS CONDITION WAS EITHER NOT ANTICIPATED OR NOT CONSIDERED TO BE RELEVANT DURING JOB PLANNING.  3. AN UNDETECTED FLAMMABLE ATMOSPHERE EXISTED WITHIN THE PIPING DURING AUTHORIZED HOT WORK ACTIVITIES.    RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS THE FINDINGS ABOVE TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE.

AS A PRECAUTION 5 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM RESIDENCES IN THE NEAR AREA. APPROXIMATELY 13 MILES OF C LINE AND 6 MILES OF D LINE WERE SHUT IN TO ENABLE ISOLATION OF THE LINE SEGMENT. AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DRAW GAS PRESSURE DOWN WITH COMPRESSION HORSEPOWER @ THE FARMINGTON COMPRESSOR STATION. AT 490 PSIG COMPRESSION WAS SHUT DOWN DUE TO HIGH ROD LOAD ON UNITS. AN EMERGENCY 1-CALL WAS MADE AND CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL WERE CALLED TO ASSIST WITH REPAIRS.

FOUR FARMTAP CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED. EXCAVATION WAS COMMENCED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FROST BALL. A HOT WATER HYDRO VAC WAS UTILIZED TO REMOVE FROST. INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A PORTION OF THE FLANGE GASKET BLOWN OUT, WHICH ALLOWED GAS LEAKAGE. THE FLANGE WAS DISASSEMBLED AND A NEW LAMONS 30"" 600 ASME B16 47A, ASME B1620, 304IR GASKET WAS INSTALLED. THE FLANGE BOLTS WERE RE-INSTALLED AND RETORQUED. ADDITIONAL CONCRETE SUPPORT BLOCKS WERE INSTALLED AND ALLOWED TO CURE. ON JUNE 28TH THE LINE WAS PURGED AND SLOWLY RELOADED TO OPERATIONAL PRESSURE, LEAK CHECKED, COATED AND BACKFILLED. A SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN ALL COST OF REPAIRS IS CALCULATED. FINAL COST WERE CALCULATED AND INITIAL COSTS WERE CHANGED/UPDATED. ON APRIL18,2011 A SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT WAS FILED AS PHMSA REQUESTED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON PIPE SPEC'S, PART C, ITEM 3 OF THE REPORT AND COST OF GAS RELEASED UNINTENTIONALLY IN PART D, ITEM 7B. THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN ADDED TO THIS SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT AS REQUESTED. SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT - THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT TO  REPORT # 20100039-15215 DATED 08/31/2010 AS A FOLLOW UP TO DISCUSSION WITH PHMSA REPRESENTATIVES. PART A ITEM 7 WAS CHANGED TO MATCH TIME ON THE NRC FORM, THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT WAS CHANGED FROM EQUIPMENT FAILURE TO INCORRECT OPERATIONS. AN ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT INDICATES THAT THERE WAS ADEQUATE, PROPER SUPPORT FOR THE PIPING, NO INDICATION OF SUBSIDENCE AND ALTHOUGH THE GASKET MATERIAL WAS NOT ANALYZED DUE TO IT'S DAMAGED CONDITION, THERE ARE TWO OTHER SIMILAR 30-INCH VALVES WITH THE SAME TYPE OF GASKETS INSTALLED ON THIS PIPING AND NEITHER OF THOSE HAVE HAD ANY PROBLEMS OR LEAKS, THIS IS A VERY GOOD, HIGH QUALITY GASKET. THE LEAKAGE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THE 6 O'CLOCK AND 9 O'CLOCK POSITION ONLY. NORTHERN BELIEVES THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS EVENT IS MOST LIKELY THAT ALL OF THE BOLTS ON THE FLANGE WERE NOT CONSISTENTLY TORQUED WHICH LED TO LEAKAGE, WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO THE GASKET FAILURE. NORTHERN IS ISSUING A TECHNICAL BULLETIN TO ALL EMPLOYEES, INSPECTORS AND CONSTRUCTION PERSONNEL RE-EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF  PROPER TORQUEING AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF ENGINEERING STANDARD 7570 WHEN JOINING OF PIPE & PIPING COMPONENTS OTHER THAN BY WELDING. SHOULD THERE BE AN EVENT OF THIS NATURE IN THE FUTURE EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT EVEN THOUGH THE GASKET MATERIAL MAY BE DAMAGED IT WILL BE SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE QUALITY OF THE GASKET WAS OR IS A FACTOR IN THE EVENT."

THE FAILURE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING (SCC). A COLONY OF SCC DEVELOPED ON THE EXTERNAL PIPE SURFACE BENEATH A LAP IN THE TAPE WRAP COATING THAT HAD DISBONDED. THE INTACT BUT DISBONDED COATING ALLOWED MOISTURE TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE PIPE SURFACE AND THE HIGH DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF THE TAPE COATING EFFECTIVELY SHIELDED THAT AREA OF THE PIPE SURFACE FROM CATHODIC PROTECTION. INDIVIDUAL SCC GREW IN LENGTH AND DEPTH COALESCED TO FORM ONE LARGE CRACK THAT EXCEEDED THE RESISTANCE OF THE MATERIAL AND CAUSED THE FAILURE.

THE TESTING CONSISTED OF FOUR TEST SECTIONS RUNNING EAST TO WEST FROM THE BRAZOS RIVER (STA. 2950+00) TO 4.5 MILES WEST OF MLV2 (STA. 4560+00). EACH TEST SECTION WAS TESTED TO A MINIMUM OF 100% SMYS FOR ONE HOUR AND THEN A SUBSEQUENT LEAK TEST AT 90% SMYS FOR A MINIMUM OF 8 HRS WITHOUT PRESSURE LOSS. SECTION 1 AND 4 SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THEIR INITIAL TESTS, SECTION 2 HAD TWO FAILURES AND SECTION 3 HAD 3 FAILURES BEFORE ACHIEVING A SUCCESSFUL TEST. IT SHOULD BE NOTED, THAT OF THE 5 FAILURES THAT OCCURRED DURING THE TESTING, THE MINIMUM FAILURE PRESSURE OCCURRED AT 84% OF SMYS INDICATING THERE WERE NO OTHER CRITICAL CRACKS THAT WOULD HAVE FAILED AT OPERATING PRESSURE.      BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE HYDROSTATIC TESTING, AND INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE RUPTURE SITE, SOIL RESISTIVITY SURVEYS AND SUBSEQUENT EXCAVATIONS, ETC FEELS THAT ALL OF THE SCC COLONIES OF A CRITICAL SIZE WERE LOCATED WITHIN THE SECTION OF LINE BETWEEN MLV1 TO MLV2.

ALL NECESSARY HOT WORK PERMITS WERE IN PLACE AT THE TIME. THE COMPRESSOR STATION HAS THREE UNITS, NONE OF WHICH WERE OPERATIONAL AT THE TIME OF THIS EVENT. UNITS NO. 1 & 2 WERE ISOLATED WITH PROPER LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT IN PLACE PER THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS & MAINTENANCE MANUAL. UNIT NO. 3 WAS NOT RUNNING AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.    THE COMPANY HAS INITIATED A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA) INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. THE COMPRESSOR MANUFACTURER ALONG WITH A FAILURE ANALYSIS INVESTIGATIVE EXPERT (CONSULTANT) CONDUCTED THEIR INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS INCIDENT.     THE RCA REPORT IDENTIFIED THAT THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WAS ARC WELDING BEING PERFORMED ON THE EXHAUST FLANGE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING.  NATURAL GAS WAS PRESENT IN THE CRANKCASE VENT DUE TO A PACKING LEAK IN THE COMPRESSOR CYLINDERS OF UNIT #3. THE PACKING LEAK ON UNIT NO. 3 TRAVELED VIA A COMMON OIL DRAIN TO THE UNIT NO. 2 COMPRESSOR CYLINDER DISTANCE PIECES AND THUS INTO THE UNIT NO.2 CRANKCASE AND VENT. GAS MONITORING WAS PERFORMED USING A GAS DETECTOR AT THE VENTS, EXHAUST, STARTERS, AND SURROUNDING AREA PRIOR TO THE WELDING AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A COMBUSTIBLE ATMOSPHERE.  IT APPEARS THAT THE GAS MONITOR WAS NOT EXPOSED TO THE COMBUSTIBLE MIXTURE LONG ENOUGH TO PROVIDE AN ALARM TO THE OPERATOR.  SHUTOFF VALVES ON THE COMMON OIL DRAIN LINE THAT SERVE TO ISOLATE EACH UNIT WERE LEFT OPEN AND WERE NOT INCLUDED AS PART OF THE LOCKOUT/TAGOUT (LOTO) PROCEDURE BEING USED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.    RECOMMENDATIONS WERE NOTED AND SHARED VIA A SAFETY ALERT BROADCAST THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COMPANY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.  AMONG THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE:    MANDATORY INSPECTION OF ALL UNITS AND FACILITIES COMPANY-WIDE FOR SIMILAR COMMON VENT/PIPING SYSTEMS THAT WERE FOUND AT THE INCIDENT SITE.  ENGINEERING SHALL REVIEW INSPECTION RESULTS, DOCUMENTATION AND ASSURE THE NECESSARY FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES ARE PLANNED AND COMPLETED. REVIEW AND PERFORM MODIFICATIONS TO STATION ISOLATION LOCK-OUT/TAG-OUT PROCEDURES TO INCLUDE DRAIN AND VENT VALVES THAT ARE COMMON WITHIN A STATION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A COMBUSTIBLE MIXTURE.      WHEN PERFORMING ""HOT WORK"" ON A COMPRESSOR UNIT, CONSIDERATIONS SHALL BE MADE FOR EVACUATING GAS FROM ALL UNITS WITHIN THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING. IDEALLY, ANY WELDING, BURNING, OPEN FLAME OR GRINDING TASKS SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN SAFE AREAS OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING. WHEN HOT WORK IS NECESSARY IN BUILDINGS WITH PRESSURIZED UNITS, IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE EQUIPMENT SPECIFIC ISOLATION AND LOTO PLANS ARE IN PLACE AND THAT HOT WORK PERMITS ARE EXECUTED TO ENSURE ABSENCE OF ANY FLAMMABLE/EXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERE.  LOTO PLANS SHOULD BE CHALLENGED AND REVIEWED BY OPERATIONS, ENGINEERING AND CONTRACTORS PERFORMING THE WORK BEFORE BEGINNING ANY WORK ON COMPRESSION UNITS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PATHS FOR A FLAMMABLE/EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE TO OCCUR."

GAS SUPERVISION ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 16:15 TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE AND IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE METHODS TO CONTROL THE RELEASE OF GAS.    THE METHOD SELECTED TO CONTROL THE RELEASE OF GAS WAS TO UTILIZE A DOWNSTREAM VALVE AND A STOPPER FITTING TO MINIMIZE CUSTOMER IMPACT.  ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE TO INSTALL THE EIGHT INCH FITTING AND STOPPER.  AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 A.M. ON SUNDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2010, THE STOPPER WAS INSTALLED AND THE DOWNSTREAM VALVE CLOSED AT THE MILTON STATION TO ISOLATE A 3,000' SECTION OF MAIN.    REPAIRS WERE STARTED SHORTLY AFTER 6:00 ONCE THE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE WAS BLOWN DOWN AND IT WAS SAFE TO APPROACH THE HIT LOCATION.  REPAIRS TO THE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE WERE COMPLETED AT 10:30 AND THE STOPPER REMOVED AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00.    THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS FAILURE OF THE EXCAVATOR TO CONTACT THE ONE-CALL-SYSTEM FOR A LOCATE REQUEST.  THE EXCAVATOR WAS AWARE OF THE ILLINOIS DAMAGE PREVENTION LAWS AND THE REQUIREMENT TO CALL IN A LOCATE REQUEST PRIOR TO EXCAVATING.

THERE WAS A WATER LEAK AT THIS SITE ALSO AND WE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY CONFIRM THAT IT WAS A GAS LEAK. WE CLOSED THE INLET BLOCK VALVE (BV42311 AT STATION 00+01) AT 0725 ON LINE A-122. THE DOWNSTREAM BLOCK VALVE (BV42312 AT STATION 175+92) WAS CLOSED AT 0755 ON LINE A-122. WE MONITORED THE LINE PRESSURE AND CONFIRMED THAT WE WERE LEAKING GAS AT 0837 ON OUR PIPELINE.  MRT'S CONTRACTOR BROUGHT IN A 6"" WATER PUMP TO REMOVE THE WATER AT 0930 SO WE COULD EXCAVATE THE AREA OF THE LEAK. THE WATER COMPANY WAS CALLED TO THE SCENE AND THEY DENIED THAT THEY HAD A LEAK. THERE WAS ALSO A LIFT STATION DRAINAGE LINE IN THIS AREA. IT WAS SHUT OFF. AT 1630 AFTER NOT MAKING MUCH PROGRESS IN THE WATER REMOVAL, THE WATER COMPANY WAS CALLED AGAIN. THEY ARRIVED AT 1745 AND CONFIRMED THAT THEY DID HAVE A LEAK. THE WATER LINE WAS SHUTOFF AND EXCAVATION WAS STARTED ONCE THE WATER WAS REMOVED.   AT 2130 A 4 BOLT LEAK CLAMP WAS INSTALLED ON THE GAS LINE TO SEAL OFF THE LEAK CAUSED BY EROSION FROM THE WATER AND SANDY SOIL. POSITIVE PRESSURE WAS MAINTAINED ON THE PIPELINE TO PREVENT WATER FROM ENTERING THE PIPE. THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN TO PREPARE FOR REPAIRS AT A LATER DATE. THE WATER COMPANY FINISHED THEIR LEAK REPAIRS AT 0230 ON DECEMBER 1ST. WATER WAS CONTINUOUSLY PUMP FROM THE AREA UNTIL DECEMBER 3RD.  MRT'S CONTRACT WELDERS STARTED FABRICATING THE REPLACEMENT PIPE AND FITTINGS AT THE COLUMBIA MEASURING STATION ON DECEMBER 1ST. ON DECEMBER 2ND, THE PIPE AND FITTINGS WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE CONTRACTORS WELDING SHOP TO FINISH THE FABRICATION AND X-RAY. AT THE LEAK SITE THERE WAS MORE EXCAVATION DONE AND A 20 FT. SECTION OF PIPE WAS REMOVED. FOREMAN PLUGS WERE INSTALLED IN THE ENDS OF THE PIPE TO PREVENT ANYTHING FROM ENTERING THE PIPELINE. AN 8 HOUR HYDROTEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEW PIPE AND FITTING ON DECEMBER 3RD.    DECEMBER 4TH THE CONTRACTOR DUG OUT MORE DITCH AND STARTED TO MAKE THE WELDS ON THE REPLACEMENT PIPE AND FITTINGS. BOTH OF THE WELDS WERE X-RAYED AND PASSED THE X-RAY.   ON DECEMBER 5TH, FINISHED DIGGING OUT THE DOWNSTREAM END OF THE LINE IN ORDER TO FINISH THE TIE-INS. THE WELDS FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY WERE BLASTED AND RECOATED. LINE WAS TIED-IN AT 1100. AFTER PASSING THE X-RAY, THE LAST WELD WAS BLASTED AND RECOATED.

THE TRENCHER STRIKE RESULTED IN TWO HOLES ON THE SIDE OF THE EIGHT INCH WBI PIPELINE RELEASING GAS THAT WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 626 PSIG.  THE GAS IGNITED AND BURNED THE TRENCHER AND TWO PICKUPS PARKED NEARBY.  NO MAJOR INJURIES OR DEATHS OCCURRED.  THE CONTRACTOR IMMEDIATELY CALLED WBI'S CONTACT PERSON, QUAIN KUDRNA, AND INFORMED HIM OF THE SITUATION.  QUAIN IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED AND NOTIFIED WBI'S GAS CONTROL.  WBI WAS ABLE TO ISOLATE THE SECTION OF PIPELINE WITHIN ONE HOUR.  THE CONTRACTOR INITIATED A ONE-CALL ON FRIDAY, 11/26/2010.  ON MONDAY, 11/29/2010, QUAIN TRAVELED TO THE PROPOSED SITE AND LOCATED WBI'S PIPELINE AT THE LOCATION WHERE THE EXISTING LIQUIDS LINE CROSSED AND NEW PIPELINE WAS PLANNED TO CROSS.  QUAIN CALLED THE CONTRACTOR CONTACT AT THAT TIME AND INFORMED HIM OF THE CROSSING AND THAT WBI WILL NEED TO BE AT THE LOCATION PRIOR TO CROSSING TO EXPOSE WBI'S PIPELINE.  THE CONTRACTOR INFORMED QUAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE AT THE LOCATION AT THE END OF THAT WEEK AND HE WOULD CALL QUAIN BACK WHEN THEY WERE THERE.  THE CONTRACTOR DID NOT CALL QUAIN BACK THAT WEEK AND THE END OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK IS WHEN THE CONTRACTOR HIT WBI'S LINE.  THE CONTRACTOR ADMITTED THAT HE FORGOT TO CALL BACK.  THE CONTRACTOR ALSO STATED THAT HE DID NOT REMEMBER SEEING THE WBI FLAGS AT THE SITE.  AFTER THE GAS WAS BLOWN DOWN AND SITE WAS DETERMINED TO BE SAFE, WBI PERSONNEL INVESTIGATED THE LOCATION.  IT WAS NOTED THAT THE CONTRACTOR HAD BLADED THE ROW PRIOR TO EXCAVATING TO REMOVE SNOW WHICH WOULD LIKELY DESTROY THE MARKER FLAGS ON THE ROW.  ONE CHARRED MARKER FLAG STILL REMAINED ON THE BLADED ROW BUT WAS FLAT ON THE GROUND.  TWO MARKER FLAGS WERE FOUND INTACT ADJACENT TO THE BLADED ROW.

KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES, INC. REPORT CONCLUSION: THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY EXTERNAL CORROSION.  THE EXTERNAL CORROSION HAD REDUCED THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS TO 0.010 INCH.  THE REMAINING WALL THICKNESS FAILED BY DUCTILE TENSILE OVERLOAD RESULTING IN A RUPTURE MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 17 INCHES LONG.

AT 17:35 CEGT SYSTEM CONTROL DISPATCHED A CEGT FIELD TECHNICIAN TO INVESTIGATE AND VERIFY THE LEAK.  AT 20:05 CEGT TECHNICIANS REPORTED TO SYSTEM CONTROL THAT THE LEAK IS JUST OFF A DIRT ROAD WITH TWO ENTRANCES.  THE LEAK IS IN THE WOODS WITH NO STRUCTURES IN THE AREA OR, BUT GAS WAS BLOWING ACROSS THE ROAD.  IT WAS STILL NOT DETERMINED IF THE LEAK BELONG TO CEGT AND SINCE IT WAS DARK IT WAS DECIDED TO MONITOR THE LOCATION OVER NIGHT.  AT 20:50 CEGT TECHNICIANS REPORTED TO SYSTEM CONTROL THAT BOTH ENTRANCES TO THE DIRT ROAD LEADING INTO THE LEAK ARE BLOCKED OFF AND WILL BE MANNED OVER NIGHT.  ON 01/12/2011AT 07:53 SYSTEM CONTROL AND OPERATIONS HELD A CALL TO PLAN THE STEPS NEEDED TO DETERMINE IF THE LEAK WAS ON A CEGT PIPELINE.  AT 10:15 SYSTEM CONTROL NOTIFIED NRC OF THE LEAK AND INDICATED CEGT WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING IF THE LEAK WAS ON CEGT'S PIPELINE.  AT 10:45 VALVES WERE SHUT ISOLATING THE PIPELINE SEGMENT WITH THE POSSIBLE LEAK AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS ON CEGT'S SYSTEM.  VALVES WERE OPENED BACK UP, BUT THE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED FROM 300 LB. TO 250 LB.  DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT LOAD IN SHREVEPORT AND THE SURROUNDING AREA, LOWERING THE PRESSURE WAS THE CHOSEN COURSE OF ACTION UNTIL NOTIFYING CUSTOMERS OF THE NEED TO REDUCE THEIR TAKES.  CEGT CONTACTED THE LARGE INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS IN THE AREA TO REQUEST THEY REDUCE THEIR TAKES AND TO NOTIFY THEM THAT THEY MAY SEE LOWER PRESSURES BEGINNING AT 13:00.  AT 16:00 THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN FROM 250# TO ZERO. A 26 FOOT SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH TESTED EMERGENCY PIPE.  AT 21:00 X-RAYS WERE COMPLETE THE LINE WAS PURGED AND PACKED.  CONTROL OF THE PIPELINE WAS GIVEN BACK TO SYSTEM CONTROL AT 22:15.       THE SECTION OF PIPE REMOVED THAT WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE CONCLUSION IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY A BUCKLE THAT FORMED IN THE PIPE WALL FROM COMPRESSIVE AXIAL OR BENDING STRESS ON THE PIPELINE.  IT IS NOT KNOWN WHEN OR HOW THE BUCKLE WAS FORMED.  THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY AXIAL TENSILE STRESS ACTING ON THE BUCKLED PIPE WHICH RESULTED IN A CIRCUMFERENTIALLY ORIENTED FRACTURE IN THE BOTTOM QUADRANT OF THE PIPE THAT EXTENDED FROM THE 3 TO 9 OCLOCK PIPE POSITIONS.  BECAUSE THE FRACTURE PROPAGATED AFTER PENETRATING THE PIPE WALL, IT IS CLASSIFIED AS A RUPTURE RATHER THAN A LEAK, EVEN THOUGH THE PIPELINE WAS NOT COMPLETELY SEPARATED.  THE BUCKLE WAS POSITIONED IN AN AREA OF REDUCED WALL THICKNESS NEAR THE END OF A JOINT OF PIPE A FEW INCHES AWAY FROM A GIRTH WELD.  THE GIRTH WELD ITSELF WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE FAILURE.  THE CURVATURE STRAIN WITH THE BUCKLES PROFILE WAS DETERMINED TO BE 9 PERCENT USING THE TEMPLATE OVERLAY METHOD , WHICH EXCEEDS THE 6 PERCENT STRAIN SAFE LIMIT.  THE PIPE JOINT WHICH CONTAINED THE FAILURE MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPROPRIATE EDITION OF API 5L.  NO OTHER DEFECTS WERE PRESENT NEAR THE FAILURE ORIGIN.  LAB ANALYSIS CONCLUDE THAT THE PIPE JOINT SPECIMEN CONTAINING THE FAILURE MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPROPRIATE EDITION OF API 5L.  TENSILE TEST RESULTS SHOWED A YIELD STRENGTH OF 41.800 PSI/API 5L REQUIREMENTS OF 30,0000 MINIMUM.  API STD 5L, TENTH EDITION, AUGUST 1944 FOR LAP-WELDED, BESSEMER LINE PIPE."

GAS IS INJECTED INTO THE STORAGE FIELD DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS AND TYPICALLY WITHDRAWN DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. DURING WITHDRAWAL, THE GAS HAS TO RUN THROUGH A JOULE-THOMSON (JT) PLANT IN ORDER TO LOWER THE BTU CONTENT OF THE GAS, BUT ALSO TO RECOVER NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGL) FROM THE GAS STREAM. THE JT UNIT WAS THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT ON 1/12/11. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:00 AM ON 1/12/11, THERE WAS A RELEASE OF GAS, AN EXPLOSION AND A FIRE IN THE JT PLANT. WHILE THE EXACT CAUSE IS NOT YET KNOWN, IT APPEARS THAT THE GAS RELEASE OCCURRED FROM A RUPTURE IN THE HOT PASS OF THE WEST GAS/GAS EXCHANGER (CALLED THE JT TOWER AT THE FACILITY). THE RESULT OF THE GAS RELEASE WAS A LARGE EXPLOSION AND FIRE. THE FIRE CONSUMED THE GAS FROM THE RELEASE (ESTIMATED TIME WAS SEVERAL MINUTES), AND THEN SOME FLAMMABLE MATERIAL (PRIMARILY INSULATION) CONTINUED TO BURN FOR SOME TIME. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO THE JT FACILITY (BOTH TRAINS), AND THE ENTIRE STORAGE FACILITY CEASED OPERATION.    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:  AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS RELEASE WAS CORROSION OF THE ALUMINUM FINS OR PLATES OF THE GAS/GAS EXCHANGER DUE TO AQUEOUS CHLORIDES OR ACIDIC COMPOUNDS IN THE GLYCOL STREAM, RESULTING IN THE FAILURE OF THE EXCHANGER.    THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN TO ENSURE SAFE OPERATION OF THE JT PLANT IN THE FUTURE ARE:  - THE ALUMINUM PLATE FIN WILL BE REPLACED WITH A CARBON STEEL SHELL AND TUBE EXCHANGER AS THE GAS/GAS EXCHANGER.   THE SHELL AND TUBE EXCHANGERS ARE MUCH LESS PRONE TO CATASTROPHIC CORROSION ISSUES DUE TO THE METALLURGY AND PHYSICAL DESIGN OF THE SHELL AND TUBE.  THE SHELL AND TUBE EXCHANGER HAS A HEAD THAT CAN BE EASILY REMOVED FOR INSPECTION OR CLEANING.  - A NEW INLET FILTER COALESCER WILL BE USED TO REMOVE MORE OF THE PARTICULATE MATTER AND CHLORIDES IN THE INLET GAS.  THE FILTER IS A FULL-FLOW FILTER, HANDLING THE ENTIRE STREAM UPSTREAM OF THE GAS/GAS EXCHANGER.    - THE GLYCOL WILL ALSO BE TESTED ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS THAN PREVIOUSLY.  THE ANALYSIS WILL CHECK FOR CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION, IRON, SULFUR, CALCIUM, PH, GLYCOL STRENGTH AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS IN GLYCOL.      IN ADDITION, THE ENTIRE JT PLANT OPERATION HAS BEEN MOVED TO A SAFER LOCATION AND ALL EXISTING EQUIPMENT WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY AND WAS DEEMED SAFE TO PUT BACK INTO OPERATION.   THE ENTIRE GLYCOL REGENERATION SYSTEM WAS ALSO INSPECTED AND CLEANED."

A TEAM MEMBER WAS SENT TO THE LEAK LOCATION TO VERIFY THE LEAK.      AT 20:48 THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED TO BE ON CEGT'S LINE BT-1-AS AND REPORTED TO SYSTEM CONTROL.  IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE A MINOR LEAK.  CEGT BEGAN WORKING WITH SGO TO UNDERSTAND THE CUSTOMER LOAD.  EMPLOYEES WERE STATIONED AT THE LEAK TO MAN IT UNTIL THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.     AT 21:15 CEGT AREA MANAGEMENT NOTIFIED SYSTEM CONTROL THAT THEY HAD GENERATED A PLAN TO LOWER THE PRESSURE ON A 16 MILE SECTION OF BT1-AS FROM 870# TO 400#.

ON 2/22/2011 AT 11:00 THE STOPPALL WAS COMPLETED AND CEGT TEAM PERSONNEL BLEW DOWN A 6.6 MILE PIPELINE SECTION CONTAINING THE LEAK.  AT 15:00 THE LEAK WAS EXPOSED ENOUGH TO DETERMINE A CAUSE, APPROXIMATELY A  4"" CRACK IN THE PIPE.      ON 2/23/2011 AT 16:30 PIPE WAS DELIVERED AND WELD CAPS WERE INSTALLED.  AT 19:00 A 4 HOUR HYDRO TEST BEGAN, IT ENDED NEAR 24:00.      ON 2/24/2011 AT 07:00 CONTRACTORS BEGAN TO REMOVE THE PIPE TO BE REPLACED.

THE SECTION OF PIPE REMOVED WAS SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FINAL FAILURE MODE WAS DUCTILE OVERLOAD OF THE REMAINING LIGAMENT BENEATH THE SCC.  THE REMAINING LIGAMENT WAS OBSERVED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS MINIMUM.  THE FACT THAT THESE CRACKS WERE CRITICAL AT THIS SIZE INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF A RELATIVELY HIGH AXIAL LOAD.  THE FINDINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS:"

SUBSEQUENTLY AFTER AN ELBOW RUPTURED THE RELEASED GAS IGNITED AND BURNED UNTIL GAS FLOW WAS STOPPED. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMENED TO BE THE FAILURE OF A CHECK VALVE IN THE TURBINE UNIT DISCHARGE LINE.  1)  CHECK VAVLE ON TURBINE UNIT T7 DISCHARGE LINE WAS DAMAGED.  CHECK VALVE INTERNALS SEPERATED WHEN CENTER BOLT FAILED. FAILURE CAUSE WAS DETERMINED TO BE OVERTORQUING OF CENTER BOLT BY MANUFUCTURE DURING VALVE ASSEMBLY.  2)  DICCHARGE VALVE ON UNIT T7 DID NOT FULLY CLOSE DURING THE UNIT SHUT DOWN BECAUSE PARTS OF THE CHECK VALVE INTERNALS WAS STUCK IN THE VAVLE.   3)  24"" ELBOW LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT ON THE SUCTION LINE OF UNIT T7 COMPRESSOR, RUPTURED FROM A MANUFACTURING DEFECT WHICH WAS WEAKENED BY THE HEAT FROM THE LUBE OIL FIRE ALOWING GAS TO BE RELEASED INTO THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING AND IGNITE.

MR. POTTER INDICATED THAT THERE WAS DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE AND THAT GAS WAS VENTING TO ATMOSPHERE. THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGED PIPELINE IS THE TRACY BRANCH LINE AT APPROXIMATE MILEPOST 0.20. THE LEGAL DESCRIPTION IS SECTION NW1/2 17, TOWNSHIP 109N, RANGE 34W ALL IN BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA APPROXIMATELY 1/2 MILE NORTH OF U.S. HIGHWAY 14 AND 1/8 MILE EAST OF COUNTY ROAD 5.  NORTHERN IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED EMPLOYEES TO THE SITE AND UPON ARRIVAL THEY CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS NORTHERN'S TRACY, MN (MNB65201) 6-INCH BRANCH LINE THAT HAD BEEN HIT. THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO EXPLOSION, NO INJURIES AND NO EVACUATIONS. A GAS DETECTOR WAS UTILIZED TO CHECK THE AREA AND A 20% LEL READING WAS INDICATED APPROXIMATELY 50 YARDS DOWNWIND. A PIR OF 109 FEET WAS ESTABLISH AS A SAFE ZONE RADIUS AROUND THE INCIDENT SITE. THE TRACY BRANCH LINE PROVIDES GAS SERVICE TO THE TOWNS OF SANBORN, WALNUT GROVE, REVERE AND TRACY, MINNESOTA AND THE HIGHWATER ETHANOL PLANT.  BOTTLE TRUCKS WERE BROUGHT IN FROM WATERLOO, IA, FARMINGTON, MN, SOUTH SIOUX CITY, IA, OGDEN, IA AND NORTH BRANCH, MN AS BACKUPS TO SUPPLY GAS TO THE TOWNS DURING THE REPAIR PROCESS. A STOPPLE BYPASS HAD TO BE INSTALLED TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO THE HIGHWATER ETHANOL PLANT DURING THE PIPELINE REPAIRS. APPROXIMATELY 31 FEET OF 6-INCH NOMINAL DIAMETER PIPE WAS REPLACED WITH NEW 6-INCH, 0.280 WALL THICKNESS, ERW, GRADE X42 TESTED PIPE WITH FBE COATING. ROOT CAUSE OF THIS EVENT:  THE LANDOWNER HAD MADE A ONE CALL, HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK AREA DID NOT COVER THE  AREA OF HIS PROPERTY THAT THE PIPELINE CROSSED, THEREFORE NORTHERN DID NOT RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF A ONE CALL REQUEST TO LOCATE AND MARK THE PIPELINE ON THE PROPERTY. THERE WAS REQUIRED PERMANENT LINE MARKERS IN THE FENCE LINES INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF A PIPELINE ON THE PROPERTY. THIS IS BEING INVESTIGATED FURTHER BY NORTHERN WITH THE LANDOWNER/CONTRACTOR AND THE ONE CALL CENTER. FILING OF AN INCIDENT REPORT WAS REQUIRED AS THE COST TO COMPLETE REPAIRS EXCEEDED THE $50,000.00 REPORTING THRESHOLD. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN ALL FINAL COST OF REPAIRS IS CALCULATED.   SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT:  REVISED COST INCURRED IN PART D, SECTION 7 AS A FINAL ESTIMATED OF ALL COST HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY NORTHERN. NO FURTHER ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED OR PLANNED OTHER THAN FOLLOW UP BY NORTHERN'S LEGAL DEPARTMENT.  THIS FINAL REPORT IS SUBMITTED TO CLOSE OUT THE ORIGINAL REPORT NO. 20110050 -15237 DATED 05/12/2011.

THE EVENT WAS AT THE COMPANY'S STATION CAMP COMPRESSOR STATION, A SMALL UNMANNED STATION IN RURAL CENTRAL KENTUCKY.  THE STATION CONSISTS OF FOUR AJAX 230 HORSEPOWER UNITS.    THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON SITE AND HAD CLOSED A ROAD ADJACENT TO THE STATION.  COMPANY EMPLOYEES HAD ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 16:00 AND CONFIRMED THAT UNIT #3 WAS ON FIRE.  BY 16:35 THE STATION WAS SHUT IN AND THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED.    AFTER A THOROUGH EXAMINATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ONLY UNIT #3 HAD BEEN DAMAGED.  IT WAS DECLARED TO BE UNAVAILABLE FOR SERVICE, PENDING FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND REPAIR.  THE OTHER UNITS WERE LATER RETURNED TO SERVICE WITHOUT INCIDENT.    THE UNITS AT THIS STATION ARE OWNED BY EXTERRAN AND LEASED TO COLUMBIA.  A REPRESENTATIVE OF EXTERRAN ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 18:45 AND PROVIDED AN INITIAL DAMAGE ESTIMATE OF $125,000 TO $250,000.  THIS ESTIMATE WAS RECEIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 19:02.  UPON RECEIPT OF THIS ESTIMATE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED.  THE NRC AND PHMSA SOUTHERN REGION OFFICES WERE NOTIFIED AT 19:44 AND 20:08 RESPECTIVELY.     OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE DAYS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE EVENT WERE ESTABLISHED.  IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE COMPRESSOR CROSSHEAD SLIDE HAD FAILED AND SIEZED ON UNIT #3.  THE RESULTANT HEAT AND DAMAGE IGNITED CRANKCASE OIL VAPORS (VIA THE OIL BREATHER) AND A NEARBY LUBE OIL DAY STORAGE TANK.  THE HEAT FROM THE OIL FIRE HAD, IN TURN, DAMAGED A VALVE IN THE STARTING GAS SYSTEM, CAUSING GAS LEAKAGE AND A SUBSEQUENT SMALL SECONDARY FIRE.  THIS SECONDARY FIRE CAUSED NO APPARENT ADDITIONAL DAMAGE.    REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE UNIT AND IT WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON MAY 27.  FINAL REPAIR COSTS TOTALLED APPROXIMATELY $120,000."

THE AREA TRAVERSED BY LINE B AND ITS UPSTREAM FEEDER LINES IS REMOTE AND RUGGED, OFTEN WITH MILES BETWEEN ROAD ACCESS POINTS.  CHECKING THE SYSTEM WAS DIFFICULT AND SLOW.  AT A FEW MINUTES AFTER 9:00, A CREW CHECKING UPSTREAM FEEDER LINE P CAME UPON A LANDSLIDE AREA.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT GAS WAS ESCAPING FROM THE COUPLED LINE IN THIS AREA.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS PART OF EASTERN KENTUCKY HAD EXPERIENCED AN UNUSUALLY WET SPRING.  THIS IS THOUGHT TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE LANDSLIDE.    THE SITUATION WAS CALLED IN TO THE CONTROL ROOM.  QUESTIONS WERE ASKED, INVESTIGATED, AND ANSWERED TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION.  AS SOON AS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED TO DETERMINE THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURED, A CALL WAS MADE TO THE NRC AND PHMSA'S SOUTHERN REGION OFFICE.    MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT WERE ASSEMBLED OVER THE NEXT DAY, AND RESTORATION WORK WAS BEGUN ON MAY 14.  THE LINE WAS READIED FOR PLACEMENT IN SERVICE BY 9:00 MAY 20, AND WAS FULLY RESTORED TO SERVICE BY 12:05 A.M. ON MAY 21.    NOTE THAT THE GAS LOSS CALCULATIONS REFLECT OUR BEST RECONSTRUCTION OF THE EVENTS AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE CONDITION.  HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT GAS LOSS VOLUME MAY HAVE EXCEEDED 3,000 MCF THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE INCIDENT."

THE NORTH SECTION WAS ALSO HYDROTESTED TO 1.5 TIMES MAOP.  THE SOUTH SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS HYDROTESTED IN 2006 AS A PART OF THE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.  MFL AND HYDROTEST DATA HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS AS A PART OF THEIR INVESTIGATION.  ON COMPLETION OF THE HYDROTEST THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE AT IT'S ORIGINAL MAOP OF 612 PSIG.       SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL 7-11-13  CORRECTED THE SMYS OF THE PIPELINE TO BE X46 IN PART C.    SUPPLEMENT FINAL 9-24-13  CORRECTED THE APPARANT CAUSE IN PART G TO ""MATERIAL FAILURE OF PIPE OR WELD"" PER FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH PHMSA.  SINCE THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, BOTH AN ILI TOOL RUN AND HYDROTEST (PRESSURE TEST) HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON LINE 9122.  THERE WAS ONE FAILURE DURING THE PRESSURE TEST AND THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE HYDROTEST FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY A ""HOOK CRACK IN THE SEAM""."

HE INFORMED SYSTEM CONTROL THAT HE MANIPULATED VALVES TO STOP THE RELEASE AT 21:29.  HE ADVISED FIRE AND POLICE HAVE CLOSED THE ROAD OUTSIDE OF THE STATION.    AT 22:41 CEGT SYSTEM CONTROL MANAGER CONTACTED PERSONNEL ON LOCATION AND CONFIRMED THAT THE ROAD CLOSURE WAS COUNTY ROAD 1280.  THE ROAD WAS REOPENED WHEN THE STATION WAS SECURED AND FIRE AND POLICE WERE RELEASED.  AMBER EMPLOYEES, ON THE SCENE, REPORTED THAT THE STATION ESD'ED AND WAS BLOWING GAS FROM THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE LINES.  EMPLOYEES OPERATED THE MAINLINE VALVE TO GET THE STATION BACK UNDER CONTROL.  EMPLOYEES BEGAN GOING THROUGH THE YARD CHECKING THE SYSTEMS.  THEY REPORTED THAT POWER AND COMMUNICATIONS WILL BE RESTORED WHEN THE STATION IS TAKEN OUT OF ESD MODE.      A LIGHTENING STORM CAUSED AN ELECTRICAL SUPPLY PROBLEM THAT IN TURN CAUSED THE STATION TO ESD.  THE STATION BACKUP GENERATOR DID NOT START.  A POWER GAS VALVE FAILED AND DID NOT ISOLATE THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE LINES, RESULTING IN GAS CONTINUING TO BLOW FROM THE MAINLINE TO THE STATION BLOW DOWN.         ON AUGUST 17, 2011 AT 01:45 AMBER TEAM EMPLOYEES HAD THE REPAIRS MADE, RESUMED NORMAL OPERATIONS AT THE STATION AND LEFT THE LOCATION."

IN LIEU OF THIS INCIDENT AND ITS INVESTIGATION, SEVERAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED AND EXECUTED AS FOLLOWS:  1. THE  ETHERNET CONNECTION BETWEEN THE REMOTE I/O PANELS AND THE GUARDLOGIC PLC SHOULD BE ELIMINATED, OR A REDUNDANT ETHERNET COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE REMOTE I/O PANELS AND THE GUARDLOGIC PLC SHOULD BE INSTALLED.  HARD-WIRING THESE DEVICES MAY  PROVIDE THE HIGHEST RELIABILITY.  2. INSTALL POINT-OF-USE FILTRATION ON ALL THE ESD OPERATOR CONTROLS THAT EMPLOY  VERSA VALVES.  IN ADDITION, IMPLEMENT THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDATION TO  AVOID THE USE OF TEFLON-TAPE ON CONTROL TUBING FOR VERSA VALVES.  THE SMALL DIAMETER OF THE INTERNALLY DRILLED PASSAGES OF THESE VALVES  IS PRONE TO BLOCKAGE BY DIRT AND DEBRIS.  3.

UPON CONFIRMING THE FIRE AND INITIATING AN ESD OF THE STATION, THE AREA WAS SECURED.  COMPANY PERSONNEL WORKED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND THE AREA.  IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DUMP VALVE FOR THE ARTEMAS B FIELD SLUG CATCHER HAD FAILED IN THE OPEN POSITION.  UPON CLOSING THIS VALVE, THE FIRE WAS FULLY EXTINGUISHED.    THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS BY A THIRD PARTY EXPERT IN METALLURGY AND FAILURE ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE RUPTURE WAS LIKELY DUE TO WATER FREEZING IN THE DRAIN LINE. THE FROZEN LIQUID CAUSED THE PIPING TO EXPAND, PRODUCING DUCTILE TEARING AT INTERNAL CORROSION FEATURES. THE RESULTANT FLAW SIZE WAS CRITICAL FOR THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES, DIMENSIONS, AND OPERATING PRESSURE OF THE PIPING.    FREEZING OCCURRED SOMETIME PRIOR TO THE FAILURE.  THE PRESENCE OF THE INTERNAL CORROSION WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE.       THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED AN INTEGRITY PLAN COVERING PRESSURIZED LIQUID/DUMP PIPING FROM VESSELS AT ITS ACTIVE COMPRESSOR STATIONS.  THE PLAN SUMMARIZES IMMEDIATE INITIAL STEPS AS WELL AS LONG TERM STEPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS DUMP/DRAIN VALVE PIPING COMPANY-WIDE."

TGP PERSONNEL RESPONDED AND ISOLATED THE VALVE SECTION.  THERE WERE NO FATALITIES NOR INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION.  INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE RESULTED IN THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO EXCESSIVE STRAIN FROM THE ONGOING PROGRESSION OF AN EARTH LANDSLIDE ON ONE OF THE PIPELINE'S GIRTH WELDS AND SUBSEQUENT FAILURE OF THE WELD.  A CRACK IN THE GIRTH WELD ACTED AS A STRESS CONCENTRATOR AND THE DISPLACEMENT (STRAIN) OF THE PIPELINE OCCURRED THROUGH THE LANDSLIDE.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES WERE INITIATED AND AT THE REQUEST OF THE TPC PLANT, A CONTROLLED SHUTDOWN WAS COORDINATED WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO GET ANOTHER SUPPLIER ONLINE BEFORE THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATED. A PORTABLE FLARE WAS BROUGHT OUT TO FLARE DOWN THE PIPELINE. THE PIPELINE WAS PURGED AND INERTED WITH NITROGEN BY APPROXIMATELY 10:00 PM ON DECEMBER 14, 2011. EXCAVATION OF THE RELEASE SITE WAS STARTED ON DECEMBER 15, 2011 AND THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPE WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE AFTERNOON LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET INSIDE THE CASING UNDER BROOKGLEN DRIVE. IT WAS DECIDED TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE BY EXCAVATING BOTH ENDS OF THE CASING AND REPLACING THE ENTIRE PIPE SECTION INSIDE IT. THE INSTALLATION OF THE CERTIFIED REPLACEMENT PIPE WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 18, 2011 AND THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON DECEMBER 20, 2011. NO FURTHER REMEDIATION OR REPAIRS ARE NECESSARY.  ANALYSIS OF THE DAMAGED AREA OF THE PIPE DETERMINED THE CAUSE TO BE EXTERNAL CORROSION DUE TO BEING SHORTED TO THE CASING. DURING EXCAVATION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE VENT PIPE WAS DETACHED FROM THE CASING RESULTING IN A BAD CP READING. NEW CASING VENTS WERE INSTALLED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CASING.

THE SEAL OIL FIRE OCCURRED ON UNIT 31, A G.E. FRAME III 9100-HORSEPOWER TURBINE COMPRESSOR, BETWEEN THE UNIT POWER TURBINE AND THE COMPRESSOR. THE FIRE AND GAS DETECTION SYSTEM DETECTED THE SEAL OIL FIRE IMMEDIATELY AND ACTIVATED THE STATION EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM, WHICH FUNCTIONED AS DESIGNED AND SAFELY SHUT DOWN THE UNIT AND THE STATION. ALL EMERGENCY VALVES TRAVELED TO THE CORRECT POSITION FOLLOWING ACTIVATION. THE ELECTRICAL POWER TO UNIT 31 WAS MANUALLY ISOLATED AND LOCKED OUT BY OPERATIONS PERSONNEL, AS IT IS NOT TRIPPED BY THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM. THIS IS BY DESIGN TO AVOID CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE TO THE TURBINES, DUE TO LACK OF LUBE OIL DURING POST-TRIP SPIN DOWN. AFTER ENSURING CONDITIONS WERE SAFE, CLIFTON VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ENTERED THE BUILDING AND EXTINGUISHED THE RESIDUAL BURNING SEAL OIL.      UNIT 31 WAS ON-LINE DECEMBER 23, 2011, WHEN THE FITTING FAILURE OCCURRED. ON DECEMBER 22, 2011, AT 3:45 P.M., OPERATIONS PERSONNEL PERFORMED A DAILY WALK THROUGH WHILE THE UNIT WAS DOWN AND NO ABNORMAL CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED. THE UNIT WAS STARTED REMOTELY BY GAS CONTROL AT 3 A.M. DECEMBER 23, 2011, AND NO WALK THROUGH WAS CONDUCTED BEFORE THE 8:58 A.M. SHUTDOWN. THE FITTING THAT FAILED IS BELIEVED TO BE PART OF THE ORIGINAL 1970 INSTALLATION.  THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS DUE TO A FAILURE IN THE THREADED 1-INCH-DIAMETER END OF A 2- TO 1-INCH-DIAMETER SWEDGE FITTING, THAT THREADED INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAL OIL PRESSURE REGULATOR. THE FITTING FAILURE ALLOWED HIGH PRESSURE COMPRESSOR SEAL OIL TO SPRAY ONTO THE BACK OF THE TURBINE EXHAUST AND IGNITE.

LOCAL TIME A SECTION OF 10-INCH DIAMETER PIPELINE IDENTIFIED AS RDU30801 NEAR MILE POST 0.34 AT THE REDFIELD, IOWA UNDERGROUND STORAGE FACILITY RUPTURED. THE PIPELINE FAILURE RESULTED IN A FIRE WHICH WAS EXTINGUISHED AT 10:51 A.M. LOCAL TIME WHEN THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED. EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM DALLAS COUNTY IOWA SECURED THE AREA UNTIL THE FIRE WENT OUT. PRESSURE ON THE LINE AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1,254 PSI. THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE FOR THE PIPELINE IS 1,385 PSI. INTERNAL CORROSION IS BELIEVED TO BE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE FAILURE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, NO EVACUATIONS AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. TWO MIDAMERICAN ENERGY COMPANY UTILITY POWER POLES WERE DAMAGED. THE RUPTURE MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 48 FEET 4-INCHS IN LENGTH. A SECTION OF THE DAMAGED PIPE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE RUPTURE ORIGIN. THE LINE OF FRACTURE TRAVELED LONGITUDINALLY THROUGH A SECTION OF CORRODED PIPE APPROXIMATELY 12-INCHS IN LENGTH. THE INTERNAL CORROSION OCCURRED AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION WITH ABOUT 90% WALL LOSS. THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED THE FRACTURE EXTENDING WEST FROM THE RUPTURE SITE STOPPED AT A GIRTH WELD. THE FRACTURE EAST ENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JOINT. NO EXTERNAL CORROSION OR EVIDENCE OF THIRD-PARTY DAMAGE WAS FOUND. THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (TICKET NUMBER 1020240) DATED 07-AUG-12. THE INCIDENT WAS ALSO REPORTED TO THE IOWA UTILITIES BOARD IN DES MOINES, IOWA AND THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION IN KANSAS CITY. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION IS IN PROGRESS AS WELL AS FOLLOW UP ANALYSIS BY OUTSIDE LABORATORIES.

SIX RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER PREMISES WERE IMPACTED BY THE CLOSURE OF THIS SECTION OF PIPELINE.  ALL IMPACTED CUSTOMERS WERE CONTACTED TO INFORM THEM OF THE SITUATION AND EXPECTATION OF OUTAGE TIMELINES.  THERE WAS ALSO AN IMPACT TO VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN OVERALL SYSTEM PRESSURES UNTIL ALTERNATIVE FLOW PATHS OCCURRED.

THIS RESULTED IN UNPLANNED RELEASE OF GAS THROUGH THE RELIEVING VALVE SYSTEM AND AN OVER PRESSURE OF CERTAIN STATION PIPING.  THE GAS EMITTED THROUGH THE RELIEF SYSTEM IGNITED.  THE PROBABLE SOURCE OF IGNITION WAS A STATIC CHARGE.  THE SYSTEM WAS ISOLATED AND FIRE EXTINGUISHED.  THE SOOT FROM THE BURNED GAS CAUSED MIST DAMAGE TO NEIGHBORING HOMES, LANDSCAPING AND VEHICLES.

BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE FOREIGN PIPELINES IN THAT AREA, IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO WHICH LINE THE SHEEN RELATED. NEVERTHELESS, OUT OF CAUTION, COLUMBIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL PERSONNEL REPORTED THE SHEEN TO THE NRC REPORT NO. 1036464 AND CERTAIN LOUISIANA AGENCIES AS APPROPRIATE. COLUMBIA CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS IN FACT A LEAK AND IF SO WHETHER SUCH LEAK WAS IN A COLUMBIA GULF OWNED PIPELINE. ATTENTION FOCUSED ON A SMALL AMOUNT OF BUBBLES REACHING THE SURFACE. FOREIGN PIPELINES WERE BLOWN DOWN BY THEIR RESPECTIVE OPERATORS. FEW BUBBLES REMAINED, ENABLING COLUMBIA TO CONCLUDE THAT ITS ABANDONED LINE BW-200 COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THE BUBBLES. NITROGEN WAS INJECTED INTO THE PIPELINE IN ORDER TO LOCATE PRECISELY IF THERE WAS A LEAK AND WHERE THE LEAK WAS LOCATED.     DIVERS WERE MOBILIZED TO EXCAVATE THE PIPELINE, LOCATE THE LEAK ON THE PIPELINE SURFACE AND IMPLEMENT REPAIRS. THIS REPAIR CONSISTED OF INSTALLING A 36-IN PRE-TESTED BOLT-ON CLAMP WHERE COLUMBIA TREATED THIS PIPELINE AS AN ACTIVE LINE RATHER THAN ABANDONED. FOLLOWING THE REPAIR, NO FURTHER BUBBLES WERE PRESENT FROM THIS LOCATION. WHILE TESTING THE REPAIR TO ENSURE ITS EFFECTIVENESS, SOME BUBBLING WAS NOTICED APPROXIMATELY 80 FEET SOUTH OF THE REPAIR LOCATION NEAR BUT NOT NECESSARILY ON THE SAME PIPELINE. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SUBSTANCE BEING RELEASED WITH THOSE BUBBLES. THIS SECOND AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND NITROGEN INJECTED INTO THE LINE. THE PRESSURE WAS HELD FOR 2 HOURS WITH NO EVIDENCE OF BUBBLING AND NO PRESSURE DROP. THE DIVER DID NOT OBSERVE ANY EVIDENCE OF A LEAK. BOTH EXCAVATION AREAS WERE BACKFILLED. COLUMBIA WILL RE-INSPECT THE AREA AFTER ALLOWING TIME FOR NORMAL SETTLING IN THE EXCAVATED AREAS (AT BOTH SITES) TO ENSURE THERE IS ADEQUATE COVER OVER THE PIPELINE AS WELL AS TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PREVIOUS SHEEN REMOVAL EFFORTS.     ORIGINAL PLANS WERE TO PIG THE LINE IN 2013. FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION, A DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO PIG AT THAT TIME. THE PIPELINE IS BEING MONITORED TO ENSURE THE CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE ARE NOT REPEATED. IF CONCERNS ARISE BASED ON COLUMBIA GULF INSPECTIONS, PIPELINE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WILL TAKE NECESSARY ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION, WHICH MAY INCLUDE PIGGING."

ON TUESDAY, MARCH 12, 2013 WHEN HE SMELLED A GAS ODOR AND HEARD GAS LEAKING.  THIS EMPLOYEE IS A QUALIFIED FIRST RESPONDER AND IMMEDIATELY REQUESTED POLICE, FIRE, AND A GAS CONSTRUCTION CREW BE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE.  (DATA FROM A PRESSURE RECORDER ON THE LINE INDICATES THAT THE LINE BREAK OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 A.M. ON SUNDAY, MARCH 10, 2013.)  WHEN AN IPL GAS CREW RESPONDED TO THE LEAK, THEY WERE INFORMED BY THE NEIGHBORING CHEMICAL PLANT PERSONNEL THAT THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN ENCROACHED UPON BY CONTAMINATED SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AND WAS NOW IN AN EPA SUPERFUND SITE.  ONLY QUALIFIED HAZWOPER PERSONNEL ARE ALLOWED TO WORK ON THE SITE, REQUIRING IPL TO LOCATE AND MOBILIZE AN OUTSIDE GAS CONTRACTOR WITH THESE SPECIALIZED QUALIFICATIONS TO PERFORM THE REPAIRS.  THE LINE IS A RADIAL FEED TO A SMALL TOWN WITH 190 CUSTOMERS AND THE LEAK WAS LOCATED ON A RURAL ROAD IN A RELATIVELY REMOTE LOCATION THAT DID NOT PRESENT AN IMMEDIATE RISK TO THE PUBLIC.  IN ORDER TO AVOID AN INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE TO THE ENTIRE TOWN DURING COLD WEATHER, A TEMPORARY, ABOVEGROUND BYPASS LINE WAS INSTALLED.  AFTER THE BYPASS STOPPERS WERE WELDED ON IN AN AREA OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL, A 2,600 FOOT LONG 2 INCH DIAMETER 100 PSIG HDPE ABOVEGROUND BYPASS LINE WAS CONSTRUCTED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE AT 11:54 P.M. ON WEDNESDAY, MARCH 13, 2013.  AT THAT POINT, THE REPAIR CONTRACTOR MOVED IN AND MADE THE REPAIRS TO THE DAMAGED LINE BY CUTTING OUT AND REPLACING A 20 FOOT SECTION OF PIPE. THE LOST GAS CALCULATION FROM SUNDAY AT 8:30 A.M. UNTIL WEDNESDAY AT 11:54 P.M. YIELDED A VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY 6,000 MCF, WHICH EXCEEDED THE INCIDENT REPORTING THRESHOLD.      THE LINE APPEARS TO HAVE FAILED FROM STRESS CRACKING AS A RESULT OF DENTS CAUSED BY PREVIOUS THIRD PARTY EXCAVATION DAMAGE.  A STORM SEWER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN THIS IMMEDIATE AREA DURING SUMMER 2011 AND THE DENTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE TEETH OF A BACKHOE/TRACKHOE BUCKET.  LEGAL ACTION TO RECOVER THE $245,000 ESTIMATED COST OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE, REPAIR, AND LOST GAS IS PENDING.    THE CONTAMINANTS IN THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER ARE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS) AND POLYNUCLEAR AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAHS), BUT DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A HARMFUL EFFECT ON EITHER THE COAL TAR ENAMEL COATING OR THE PIPE.  CATHODIC PROTECTION READINGS ON THE LINE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY GOOD.  DISCUSSIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE REGARDING RE-ROUTING THE PIPELINE AWAY FROM ITS EXISTING LOCATION, BUT NO FIRM PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AT THIS TIME.    ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION AS REQUESTED BY OPS CENTRAL REGION OFFICE.  WHERE APPROPRIATE, CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE QUESTIONS REFERENCED:  C6 - SELECTION IS LEFT AS RUPTURE, RATHER THAN PUNCTURE.  INITIAL DAMAGE DID NOT PIERCE THROUGH THE PIPE WALL, BUT CAUSED A DENT THAT CREATED A STRESS CONCENTRATOR THAT EVENTUALLY CAUSED THE PIPE TO FAIL CIRCUMFERENTIALLY.  E5A AND E5B - VALVES WERE NOT USED TO ISOLATE THE DAMAGE.  HOWEVER, TWO MUELLER ANSI 600 TWO PIECE LINE STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED TO UTILIZE A BYPASS LINE TO AVOID A CUSTOMER OUTAGE.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN ANSWER FOR QUESTIONS E5A AND E5B, ""MANUAL"" VALVE WAS SELECTED.  G14 AND G15 - IPL PERSONNEL WERE PRESENT WHEN THE LINE WAS INITIALLY EXPOSED IN 2011 FOR THE SEWER PROJECT, AND THE LOCATE MARKS WERE ACCURATE AT THAT TIME.  G16 - DID THE DAMAGE CAUSE AN INTERRUPTION IN SERVICE? THIS QUESTION APPEARS ON THE PRINTED VERSION OF THE REPORT, BUT IS ABSENT ON THE ONLINE ENTRY FORM.  THE CORRECT ANSWER IS ""NO"".  G17 - CGA FIRST AND SECOND LEVEL DIRT ROOT CAUSES:  RESPONSES WERE REVISED TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ROOT CAUSE - EXCAVATION PRACTICES NOT SUFFICIENT AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE."

THE FAILED FITTING WAS A OEM STANDARD SUPPLIED FITTING, WHICH IS PART OF THE PILOT SENSING SYSTEM. THE OEM HAS DESIGNED A NEW HIGH STRENGTH, STAINLESS STEEL COMPONENT WHICH WILL REPLACE THOSE EXISTING PILOTS WITH SIMILAR RELIEF PILOT INSTALLATIONS. THIS WORK WILL BE COMPLETED IN 2013. OVER-PRESSURE WAS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FITTING FAILURE."

MR. WEISS INDICATED THAT EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE ON-SITE AND THAT THEY HAD BLOCKED OFF A SECTION OF THE ROAD. HE INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO RESIDENCES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. A REPRENTATIVE FROM MIDWEST NATURAL GAS CALLED TO CONFIRM THAT NATURAL GAS APPEARED TO BE BLOWING FROM VENT CASINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE LOCATION IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILES WEST OF THE TOWN OF MONDOVI, WISCONSIN. NORTHERN COMPANY EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE AND A GAS MANAGEMENT PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO REDUCE PRESSURE ON THE THE PIPELINE TO APPROXIMATELY 520-550 PSIG FROM A TYPICAL 795 PSIG. PRESSURE WAS REDUCED BY PINCHING BLOCK VALVES AND LETTING CUSTOMER USAGE PULL THE PRESSURE DOWN ON THE LINE THEN CLOSELY MONITORING. EMERGENCY STOPPLE AND BYPASS PIPING WAS BROUGHT ON-SITE TESTED AND PLACED IN-SERVICE. MICHELS CONSTRUCTION, A CONTRACTOR, ASSISTED WITH EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES ON BOTH SIDE OF THE ROAD. UPON COMPLETION OF EXCAVATION A CRACK IN A PIPING GIRTH WELD WAS FOUND ON THE UNDER SIDE (SIX O'CLOCK POSITION) WHICH WENT ENTIRELY THROUGH THE PIPE, THE CRACK WAS APPROXIMATELY 4 1/2 INCHES LONG AND ONE SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH WIDE. THE STEELE COUNTY ROAD DEPARTMENT WAS CONTACTED AND AGREED THAT NORTHERN COULD OPEN CUT THE ROAD FOR INSTALLING NEW TESTED PIPE. NORTHEN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESTORATION OF THE ROAD AND HARD SURFACING. APPROXIMATELY 60-FEET OF NEW TESTED, COATED PIPE WAS INSTALLED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, NO FIRE, NO EVACUATIONS AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. THE PIPE WITH THE CRACKED GIRTH WELD WAS SENT TO AN OUTSIDE METALLURGICAL LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN RESULTS FROM THE METALLURICAL LABORATORY TESTS ARE RECEIVED AND A TOTAL COST OF THE REPAIRS IS COMPLILED. SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT (REFERENCE INITIAL REPORT 20130040 - 15978 DATED 05/13/2013 - THE FINAL COST FOR THIS EVENT HAS BEEN UPDATED. A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED BY BRYAN LABORATORY, INC. WITH FINDINGS OF THAT THE PIPE AT BOTH GIRTH WELDS EXAMINED WERE FOUND TO EXHIBIT MISALIGNMENT AND APPEAR TO BE DISTORTED. EXTRANEOUS WELDING WIRE WAS NOTED PROTRUDING FROM THE INTERNAL PORTIONS OF THE WELD. THE CRACK WAS FOUND TO BE 6-INCHES LONG AND IN THE LOWER QUADRANT OF THE WELD. ""NECKING DOWN"", TYPICAL OF DUCTILE OVERLOADING FRATURING, WAS NOTED IN THE PIPE ON THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE CRACKED AREA. IN THE LABORATORIES OPINION, THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY BENDING FORCES, AS SHOWN BY THE DISTORTION OF THE PIPE AT THE GIRTH WELD. BLACK DEPOSITS ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE CRACK AT THE OUTSIDE SURFACE SHOWED THAT A CRACK APPROXIMATELY 0.025 INCHES DEEP PRECEDED FINAL SEPARATION. FINAL SEPARATION INITIATED AT THE PREEXISTING CRACK AND FINAL SEPARATION WAS BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD. A COPY OF THE METALLURICAL REPORT IS ATTACHED."

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE SAFEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO ALLOW THE FIRE TO BURN DOWN AND EXHAUST THE AVAILABLE FUEL BEFORE STARTING FIRE SUPPRESSION.  THE FIRE BURNED APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS BEFORE IT WAS FULLY EXTINGUISHED.  THE FIRE INVOLVED A COVERED COMPRESSOR ENCLOSURE.  THE ENCLOSURE IS A ROOFED STRUCTURE WITH OPEN SIDES (NO WALLS).  FOUR SOLAR SATURN PACKAGE COMPRESSOR UNITS WERE INSTALLED INSIDE THE ENCLOSURE.  UNITS 2 & 3 WERE FULLY INVOLVED IN THE FIRE AND SUSTAINED HEAVY DAMAGE.  UNITS 1 & 4 SUSTAINED LIGHT DAMAGE.  NO NATURAL GAS PIPING AT THE STATION WAS BREACHED OR DAMAGED BY THIS INCIDENT.  THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS INVESTIGATED AND COULD NOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO THE FIRE DAMAGE TO THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.  BOTH LUBE OIL AND RESIDUAL NATURAL GAS IN THE UNIT PIPING FUELED THE FIRE WHICH WERE ALLOWED TO BE CONSUMED BEFORE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EXTINGUISHED THE REMAINDER OF THE FIRE.    THIS INCIDENT WAS TELEPHONICALLY REPORTED TO THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION AT 22:40 ON MAY 8, 2013.  THE COMMISSION REPORT NUMBER IS 810."

THE BATTERY CHARGER THAT WAS SPIKING HIGH TOOK OVER THE LOAD AND THEN FAULTED LOW RESULTING IN A LOW 24VDC SUPPLY TO THE CONTROL PANEL.     THE LOW VOLTAGE AT THE CONTROL PANEL RESULTED IN VARIOUS DIGITAL INPUT AND OUTPUT CARDS TO FAIL WHICH RESULTED IN THE ESD EVENT.  ALTHOUGH THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES INDICATED CLOSED, THE DISCHARGE VALVE DID NOT FULLY CLOSE AND HAD TO BE MANUALLY ACTUATED TO FULLY CLOSE.  THE CLOSED STATUS, WHICH DROPS THE OUTPUT TO THE VALVE, WAS AN INACCURATE INDICATION CREATED DUE TO THE LOW VOLTAGE SUPPLYING THAT DIGITAL INPUT CARD.    GAS CONTROL DISPATCHED FIELD PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE THE STATION SHUTDOWN AND WHEN PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE, THEY DISCOVERED THAT GAS WAS STILL VENTING FROM THE STATION VENT VALVE.  TECHNICIANS MANUALLY CLOSED THE STATION DISCHARGE VALVE TO ISOLATE THE STATION FROM THE MAINLINE AND THE STATION THEN VENTED DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.

PIPELINE INSPECTORS VISITED THE SITE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ON 10/31/2012 TO VERIFY THE LEAK AND TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS ON PPG'S ETHYLENE PIPELINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 16:45 ON 10/31/2012 OPERATIONS BEGAN DEPRESSURIZING THE ETHYLENE PIPELINE WHICH CONTINUED UNTIL 11/5/2012 WHEN PURGING WITH NITROGEN BEGAN.  PURGING AND DEPRESSURIZATION TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE WAS COMPLETE ON 11/7/2012.    THE LEAK SITE WAS THEN EXCAVATED AND THE SECTION OF LEAKING PIPE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH NEW 8 INCH, 0.219 WT, GRADE B X42, FBE COATED, PRESSURE TESTED PIPE.  A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY EXTERNAL CORROSION DUE TO INDUCED AC CURRENT ON THE PIPELINE AND A SMALL AREA OF DAMAGE TO THE PIPE COATING WHICH EXPOSED THE STEEL PIPE.  THE DAMAGE TO THE PIPE COATING WAS THEORIZED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A PROBE STRIKE THAT OCCURRED WHEN SOMEONE WAS LOCATING THE PIPELINE.  THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 11/11/2012.    AT THE TIME OF THE LEAK PPG PIPELINE SUPERVISION DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION MET THE DEFINITION OF AN INCIDENT AS DEFINED BY 49 CFR 191.3; THE LEAK OCCURRED IN A VERY REMOTE AREA IN THE CALCASIEU PARISH MARSH (AT LEAST 5 MILES TO THE NEAREST DWELLING), THERE WERE NO DEATHS OR INJURIES, NO EXPLOSION OR FIRE, AND ACTUAL CALCULATED GAS LOST WAS 866 MCF (WELL BELOW THE 3 MILLION CUBIC FEET DEFINED AS AN INCIDENT).  THE ONLY DIRECT PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS TO A SECTION OF 8 INCH UNDERGROUND PIPING AND THAT REPAIR WAS ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN $50,000.  THEREFORE, BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED BY PPG'S PIPELINE SUPERVISION THAT NOTIFICATION TO THE NRC WAS NOT REQUIRED AND SUBMISSION OF AN ELECTRONIC WRITTEN REPORT TO PHMSA WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE EVENT WAS NOT REQUIRED.    THIS YEAR PPG'S PIPELINE SUPERVISOR ATTENDED A THIRD PARTY DOT PIPELINE COMPLIANCE TRAINING CLASS AND WAS INFORMED THAT PROPERTY DAMAGE INCLUDED ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING A LEAK; NOT JUST THE COST FOR THE IMMEDIATE REPAIR TO THE PIPE.

CAUSE OF RUPTURE   PSNC ENERGY DETERMINED FROM THE INVESTIGATION OF THE REMOVED SECTION OF T-33 AND OBSERVATIONS MADE DURING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE / RESTORATION EFFORTS THAT THE RUPTURE WAS CAUSED BY MECHANICAL DAMAGES THAT OCCURRED DURING THE 2003 INSTALLATION OF THE 4-INCH PLASTIC DISTRIBUTION.  THE DISTRIBUTION PIPE WAS INSTALLED BY PSNC ENERGY'S CONTRACTOR USING A HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL BORE METHOD.  AT THE TIME OF THE 2003 CONSTRUCTION, SAND HILL ROAD HAD NOT BEEN WIDENED TO THE POINT WHERE IT EXTENDED OVER T-33.  THE LOCATION OF T-33 WAS NOT PROPERLY IDENTIFIED AND THE BORE PATH FOR THE DISTRIBUTION LINE WAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS T-33.  WHILE FOLLOWING THE T-33 DITCH LINE THE BORING HEAD CREATED SHALLOW SCRATCHES ALONG T-33.  THE DIRECTIONAL BORING HEAD HIT THE 18-INCH CULVERT AND CREATED DEEP GOUGES AS THE HEAD WAS ROTATED TO CLEAR THE OBSTRUCTION.  THE DEEP GOUGES CREATED SHEAR CRACKS WHICH SET UP CONDITIONS THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE RUPTURE OF THE PIPELINE.  THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY METALLURGICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. P.A. REPORT 2014141 (3/20/2014).  THIS REPORT DISCOUNTED ANY ADDITIONAL STRESSES CREATED BY THE CULVERT.      REMEDIAL ACTIONS  PRESSURE ON T-33 WAS LIMITED TO 175 PSIG FROM THE TIME OF THE TEMPORARY REPAIR UNTIL PERMANENT REPAIRS COULD BE MADE.  PSNC ENERGY FILED A SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH 49 CFR PART 191.25 ON JANUARY 15, 2014.      PSNC ENERGY MADE THE DECISION TO REPLACE THE 1,000 FOOT SECTION OF T-33 THAT RAN PARALLEL TO THE 4-INCH DISTRIBUTION LINE.  ONSITE CONSTRUCTION BEGAN ON JANUARY 16, 2014 AND THE NEW SEGMENT WAS IN SERVICE ON FEBRUARY 1, 2014 WHICH CORRECTED THE PIPELINE ISSUES WHICH CREATED THE SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT. SYSTEM PRESSURE HAS BEEN RESTORED TO 350 PSIG AND THE SCADA ALARMS HAVE BEEN RESET.  AN UPDATE OF THE STATUS OF THE SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT WAS PROVIDED TO CHRIS TAYLOR, PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION - SOUTHERN REGION, BY EMAIL FROM SCOTT SWINDLER ON MARCH 3, 2014.      DAMAGE ESTIMATES  THE FIRE AND RUPTURE CAUSED DAMAGE TO SEVERAL CARS, HOMES AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN THE AREA.  IN ADDITION, THE ROAD, AND SEVERAL OTHER UTILITIES WERE DAMAGED.

UIS COORDINATED THE REMOVAL OF THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPING FROM THE GAS FIRED HEATER ON 4/1/14.  AN INTACT EXEMPLAR PIPE SECTION FROM A LOWER ELEVATION WITHIN THE GAS FIRED HEATER WAS ALSO REMOVED AT THE SAME TIME TO BE ANALYZED WITH THE FAILED SECTION.  THE SAMPLES WERE SENT TO FORENSIC CONSULTANTS GROUP, LLC (FCG) IN DENVER, CO TO EVALUATE THE FAILED PIPE SECTION AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT MATERIAL SELECTION, PRE-EXISTING DAMAGE, USER ERROR, OPERATING CONDITIONS, AND/OR DESIGN/MANUFACTURING DEFECTS CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE OBSERVED FAILURE.    FCG FINDING:  - THE ""FISHMOUTH"" TYPE RUPTURE IN THE SPOOL PIECE SHOWED EXTENSIVE DEFORMATION AND THINNING TYPICAL OF A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM OVERHEAT FAILURE.  - EXTENSIVE SECONDARY CRACKING WAS NOTED IN BOTH THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SPOOL PIECE AND IN THE SPOOL PIECE MATERIAL ITSELF.  THE PRESENCE OF THE EXTENSIVE SECONDARY CRACKING ALONG WITH THE CRACKING THAT LED TO THE FAILURE SHOWS THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A UNIFORM CONDITION IN THE PIPING SUCH AS EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, OR INADEQUATE WALL THICKNESS RATHER THAN AN ISOLATED DEFECT.  - THE ULTIMATE FAILURE OF THE SPOOL PIECE WAS CAUSED BY ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE THINNING OF THE TUBE WALL AND THE INITIATION AND GROWTH OF CREEP CRACKS TO THE POINT WHERE THE REMAINING CROSS SECTION COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE INTERNAL GAS PRESSURE.  - THE RESULTS OF THE OPTICAL EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY (OES) OF THE MATERIAL SHOWED THAT THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION WAS WITHIN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SA106 GRADE B MATERIAL.  - THE RESULTS OF THE TENSILE TESTS INDICATE THAT THE SPOOL PIECE AND THE ADJACENT PIPING MATERIAL MET THE MECHANICAL PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS OF SA106 GRADE B MATERIAL.  WBI HAS ANALYZED THE FINDINGS IN THE FCG REPORT AND HAVE INITIATED TAKING SEVERAL STEPS TO PREVENT THIS INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN ON THE REPLACEMENT UNIT AND ON EXISTING UNITS.   DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW GAS FIRED HEATER, WBI WILL REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURE OF THE GAS FIRED HEATER TO BE ONSITE FOR THE STARTUP/COMMISSIONING AND VERIFICATION OF ALL LOGIC, SYSTEM INTERLOCKS, AND SHUTDOWNS.  ADDITIONAL SHUTDOWNS WILL BE ADDED TO THE LOGIC INCLUDING A SHUTDOWN REQUIRING THE REGEN COMPRESSOR TO BE IN A RUN STATE FOR THE GAS FIRED HEATER TO BE IN OPERATION AND A SECONDARY DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SHUTDOWN DEVICE WILL BE ADDED TO MEASURE FLOW GOING INTO THE GAS FIRED HEATER AND SHUTDOWN ON LOW FLOW CONDITIONS.     IN ADDITION TO THE STEPS WBI WILL TAKE ON THE REPLACEMENT GAS FIRED HEATER UNIT, WBI WILL ALSO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH OUR EXISTING UNITS TO CONFIRM THEY ARE IN SATISFACTORY OPERATIONAL CONDITION.    PRIOR TO THE END OF 2014 WBI WILL:    - DEVELOP A PLAN TO VERIFY THE INTEGRITY OF THE TUBING BUNDLES TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF TUBE SWELLING AND CRACKING AND FULLY IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN WITHIN 12 MONTHS,   - ESTABLISH CRITERIA AND VERIFY THAT SYSTEM SHUTDOWNS OCCUR QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANY DAMAGE FROM OCCURRING IN THE CASE OF A UNIT MALFUNCTION, AND  - INSPECT AND CALIBRATE ALL GAS FIRED HEATER EQUIPMENT.    WBI WILL STANDARDIZE THE INSPECTION AND CALIBRATION FORM AND REQUIRE THAT ALL STATIONS INSPECT AND CALIBRATE ALL GAS FIRED HEATER EQUIPMENT ANNUALLY; AND WBI WILL IMPLEMENT THE DEVELOPED INSPECTION PLAN OF THE TUBING BUNDLES TO BE DONE EVERY THREE YEARS.  WBI FEELS IMPLEMENTING THE ABOVE DESCRIBED PROCESSES IS A PRUDENT APPROACH TO MITIGATING SAFETY CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT."

FINAL LEAK (METALLLURGICAL) EVALUATION  -   THE TOE CRACK OBSERVED IN THE MAIN LINE PIPE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A HYDROGEN INDUCED CRACK, OR COLD CRACK.THE HYDROGEN WOULD HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED DURING THE WELDING PROCESS, ALTHOUGH LOW-HYDROGEN ELECTRODES CAN HELP REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR HYDROGEN ENTRAPMENT. HARDENED MICROSTRUCTURES IN THE HEAT-AFFECTED ZONE OF A WELD CAN BE PRODUCED BY EXCESSIVE COOLING RATES AND THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE PRE- AND POST-HEAT WELD PROCEDURES. THE AMOUNT OF PRE- AND POST-HEAT DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WALL THICKNESS AND THE CARBON EQUIVALENT OF THE PIPE. RESIDUAL STRESSES CAUSED BY RESTRAINT INDUCED DURING WELDING ARE ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO HYDROGEN CRACKING."

THE PIPE FAILURE PIECE WAS SENT TO STRESS ENGINEERING IN HOUSTON FOR TESTING.    METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS COULD NOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE.

GAS CONTROL DID RECEIVE A CALL AT 0630 HOURS FROM THE PUBLIC REPORTING BLOWING GAS IN A RURAL AREA APPROXIMATELY 6 MILES SOUTH OF PENWELL, TX AND 1/2 MILE EAST OF ROAD FM 1601 IN ECTOR COUNTY. OWT PERSONNEL WERE DIRECTED TO THIS SITE AND WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF BLOWING GAS AS OWT LINE 4000-000, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE JV OR JOINT VENTURE LINE. BLOCK VALVES UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE SITE WERE MANUALLY CLOSED BY 0725 HOURS AND THE ISOLATED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS ALLOWED TO BLOW DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. THE SITE IS RURAL AND THERE WERE NO BUILDINGS INTENDED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY WITHIN 1/2 MILE OF THE SITE.  LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE ON SITE WHEN OWT PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT 0645 HOURS. THERE WAS NO FIRE OR EXPLOSION DUE TO THE RELEASE. THE PIPE THAT FAILED WAS SECURED AND SENT TO A LAB IN TULSA, OK TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE.         UPDATE: THE FAILURE ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY ELEMENT LABS IN TULSA, OK CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS AN INITIAL DUCTILE FAILURE OF A FIELD MADE GIRTH WELD WHICH INITIATED THE FAILURE OF THE ADJOINING PIPE JOINT LONG SEAM.  THE THIRD PARTY FAILURE ANALYSIS INDICATED THE CAUSE OF THE GIRTH WELD FAILURE WAS AN APPROXIMATELY ONE QUARTER INCH DIAMETER VOID LOCATED AT THE LOCATION OF AN ADJOINING LONGITUDINAL PIPE JOINT SEAM.  THIS GIRTH WELD ALSO HAD AREAS OF INCOMPLETE FUSION AND FAILED DUE TO DUCTILE OVERLOAD IN THE VICINITY OF THE VOID.

THE RELIEF VALVE IS LOCATED ON MAINLINE BLOCK VALVE IDENTIFIED AS BBB01 BETWEEN TWO MAINLINES; M880B AND M883B. THE PIPELINES ARE ALSO PROTECTED BY A CONTROL VALVE WITH PRESSURE OVERRIDE AND SLAM VALVES THAT THE ATLAS PIPELINE MIDKIFF AND WEST TEXAS GAS (WTG) SONORA / BENEDUM RECEIPT POINTS. THIS IS A VERY REMOTE AND UNATTENDED LOCATION. ON APRIL 11, 2014 AT 05:30 THE RELIEF VALVE VENTING WAS IDENTIFIED BY AN ATLAS EMPLOYEE WHILE PERFORMING ROUTINE MAINTENANCE ON THEIR EQUIPMENT NEARBY. THE VENTING WAS SO SMALL THAT SCADA DID NOT DETECT ANY NOTICABLE DROP IN PRESSURES. THE NATURAL GAS VENTING OVER A 3 DAY PERIOD MADE THIS EVENT A REPORTABLE INCIDENT.    THE PIPELINE HAS A 550 MAOP AND THE RELIEF VENTED AT 545 AND NEVER COMPLETELY RESET. THE CAUSE OF THE RELIEF VALVE VENTING HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.    **UPDATE** THE DOWNSTREAM COMPRESSOR STATION (SPRABERRY) HAD CONDUCTED ITS' ANNUAL ESD TESTING AND WAS NOT COMPRESSING. DELIVERIES WERE STILL BEING MADE TO THE PIPELINE SYSTEM AND THE PRESSURE BEGAN TO RISE. FORTUNATELY, THE 30-INCH PIPELINE IS NEARLY 100 MILES LONG SO PRESSURES INCREASED SLOWLY. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE RELIEF WAS SET BELOW THE PIPELINE MAOP AND BEGAN TO WEEP. FURTHERMORE, THE RELIEF VALVE IS AN OLD STYLE AND DID NOT RESET IMMEDIATELY, THEREBY CAUSING GAS TO EXPEL TO ATMOSPHERE FOR SOME TIME.    ***ADDITIONAL INFO*** AFTER DISCOVERY, THE RELIEF VALVE WAS TESTED AND RESET. IT IS STILL SET BELOW THE ACTUAL MAOP OF THE PIPELINE. THE MAOP IS ""GRANDFATHERED"". THE PIPELINE IS UNDER A SELF-IMPOSED PRESSURE RESTRICTION CONSIDERING OPERATING HISTORY AND KNOWN CORROSION.

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT THE 8-INCH SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE WAS OPEN WITH NO ALARM OR SHUTDOWN INDICATION.  THE 8""  SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE VENTED THE GAS INTO THE STATION BLOWDOWN SILENCER, WHICH LIMITS NOISE AND RESTRICTS FLOW VOLUME.  IN ADDITION, THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES REMAINED OPEN, AS THE STATION HAD NOT SHUT IN. THE STATION TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY SHUT IN THE STATION, WHICH WAS NOT OPERATING AT THE TIME, AND ISOLATED IT FROM THE PIPELINE BY CLOSING THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES.  GAS CONTROL WAS THEN NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION.  INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE STATION SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE PNEUMATIC PILOT PRESSURE SWITCH HAD ACTIVATED BECAUSE WATER HAD ACCUMULATED AND FROZE IN THE SWITCH AND PILOT GAS SENSING LINES RESULTING IN A LOSS OF PRESSURE TO THE SWITCH.  THE LOSS OF PILOT GAS CAUSED THE PILOT PRESSURE SWITCH TO CHANGE STATE AND TO PNEUMATICALLY COMMAND THE BLOWDOWN VALVE TO ITS FAILSAFE POSITION, WHICH IS OPEN. LIQUIDS AND ICE WERE REMOVED FROM THE AFFECTED TUBING AND SWITCH, AS WELL AS FROM SIMILAR COMPONENTS ELSEWHERE AT THE STATION, THE AFFECTED BLOWDOWN VALVE WAS TESTED, AND STATION WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE THE FOLLOWING WEEK.  RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO MODIFY THE TUBING TO THE AFFECTED SWITCHES TO ELIMINATE THE ACCUMULATION OF LIQUIDS.  IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED TO MODIFY STATION CONTROL LOGIC TO SHUT DOWN THE STATION AND CLOSE THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES WHEN ANY BLOWDOWN VALVE INDICATES OPEN AND TO ANNUNCIATE AN ALARM TO GAS CONTROL."

WARD,GAS REGULATORY SERVICES LEAD,517-545-8746,amanda.ward@cmsenergy,"AT APPROXIMATELY 9:20 AM ON APRIL 27, 2014, OILY LIQUIDS CAUSED THE PRIMARY WORKER AND MONITOR REGULATORS AT WEST WAYNE CITY GATE (29380 W. 13 MILE ROAD; FARMINGTON HILLS, MI) TO FAIL.  LIQUIDS WERE FOUND IN THE REGULATORS, PILOTS, AND PILOT FILTERS OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR RUN, AS WELL AS IN AND AROUND THE CITY GATE HEATER.  A WORN DIAPHRAGM WAS ALSO OBSERVED ON THE PRIMARY WORKER REGULATOR.    THE DOUBLE REGULATOR FAILURE RESULTED IN AN OVERPRESSURE OF THE 340 PSIG MAOP DOWNSTREAM SYSTEM.  THE OVERPRESSURE EVENT WAS ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED VIA SCADA ALARMS BY CONSUMERS ENERGY'S GAS CONTROL AT APPROXIMATELY 9:24 AM, WHEN AN OUTLET PRESSURE OF 426 PSIG WAS MEASURED.  FIELD PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO WEST WAYNE CITY GATE AT 9:25 AM.  PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT 10:15 AM, AND THE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEM PRESSURE WAS REDUCED TO BELOW 340 PSIG AT 10:27 AM.  THE MAX PRESSURE REACHED DURING THE OVERPRESSURE EVENT WAS 455 PSIG (134% MAOP) AT APPROXIMATELY 9:48 AM.    FURTHER DOWNSTREAM OF WEST WAYNE CITY GATE, A SLUG OF LIQUIDS ALSO CAUSED A DOUBLE REGULATOR FAILURE AT A WORKER-MONITOR HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION REG STATION AT 12 MILE AND FRANKLIN ROADS, CAUSING THE MAOP OF THE MEDIUM PRESSURE SYSTEM (60 PSIG MAOP) DOWNSTREAM OF THAT FACILITY TO BE EXCEEDED AS WELL.  PRESSURES ON THIS SYSTEM REACHED 104 PSIG (173% MAOP) ACCORDING TO PRESSURE RECORDING CHARTS AT 12 MILE AND FRANKLIN. THIS RESULTED IN A VENTING RELIEF VALVE AT ANOTHER NEARBY REGULATOR STAND (LOCATED AT 29257 CHATEAU COURT, FARMINGTON HILLS AND FEEDING THE SAME 60 PSIG MAOP SYSTEM) DUE TO BACKPRESSURE.  THE BLOWING RELIEF WAS DISCOVERED AT 6:10 PM ON APRIL 27, AND VENTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 90 MINUTES.    IN SUMMARY, THREE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS WERE IMPACTED BY THE OVERPRESSURE EVENT:       - APPROXIMATELY 5.25 MILES OF 10"" STEEL PIPING (340 PSIG MAOP) OPERATING AT > 20% SMYS (AND THEREFORE CLASSIFIED AS TRANSMISSION PIPE, THOUGH OPERATED BY GAS DISTRIBUTION) RUNNING SOUTH OF WEST WAYNE CITY GATE ALONG MIDDLEBELT ROAD TO 8 MILE ROAD       - APPROXIMATELY 1.25 MILES OF 8"" STEEL HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION PIPING (340 PSIG MAOP) RUNNING EAST OF WEST WAYNE CITY GATE ALONG 13 MILE ROAD AND THEN SOUTHEAST ALONG NORTHWESTERN HIGHWAY, TO REGULATOR STATION AT 12 MILE & FRANKLIN ROADS       - APPROXIMATELY 87 MILES OF STEEL AND PLASTIC MEDIUM PRESSURE MAIN AS WELL AS 2,944 SERVICES (60 PSIG MAOP) IN FARMINGTON AND SOUTHFIELD TOWNSHIPS, DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATOR STATION AT 12 MILE & FRANKLIN ROADS    MOBILE AND WALKING LEAK SURVEY WAS PERFORMED ON THE OVERPRESSURED FACILITIES BETWEEN APRIL 28TH AND APRIL 30TH.  ADDITIONALLY, OVER 20 GALLONS OF LIQUIDS WERE COLLECTED FROM SURROUNDING DRIP SITES, WITH THE MAJORITY COLLECTED AT THE REGULATOR STATION AT 12 MILE & FRANKLIN.    FOLLOW-UP LABORATORY ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE COMPOSITION OF LIQUIDS COLLECTED AT WEST WAYNE CITY GATE AND 12 MILE & FRANKLIN WAS CONSISTENT WITH COMPRESSOR ENGINE OIL UTILIZED AT CONSUMERS ENERGY COMPRESSOR STATIONS.  AN PROGRAM OF ACCELERATED INSTALLATION OF FILTERS/SEPARATORS AT CONSUMERS ENERGY CITY GATE AND REGULATOR STATION FACILITIES IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY TO HELP PREVENT RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR DAMAGE BY DEBRIS/LIQUIDS TO REGULATORS AND OVERPRESSURE PROTECTION DEVICES."

SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:    BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, PLAINS HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE FAILURE WAS THE RESULT OF INTERNAL DETONATION THAT RESULTED IN SUDDEN OVER-PRESSURE OF THE PIPING AND OTHER COMPONENTS.  AIR MOVERS HAD BEEN USED TO DE-ENERGIZE A PREVIOUSLY DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPELINE PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT OF JUNE 7, 2014. AS THE PIPELINE WAS BROUGHT BACK INTO SERVICE, THE AIR WAS DISPLACED BY FLOWING PIPELINE GAS TO AND THROUGH THE VECTOR STATION TO A SILENCER EQUIPPED VENT AT THE BOOSTER STATION. THIS WAS DONE TO MINIMIZE NOISE AND DISTURBANCE TO NEARBY RESIDENCES AND LIVESTOCK. IT APPEARS THAT THE AIR HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETELY ELIMINATED FROM ALL OF THE PIPING DURING THE STATION PURGING. AS THE VECTOR STATION WAS BEING PRESSURIZED TO THE NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS (PIPELINE PRESSURE), THE HEAT OF COMPRESSION COMBINED WITH THE RESIDUAL AIR INCREASED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE GAS TO AUTO IGNITE.   THE SUBSEQUENT IGNITION OF THE FLAMMABLE GAS RESULTED IN A DETONATION/OVERPRESSURE INSIDE THE PIPE. THE PURGING PROCEDURES FOR THE PNGS PIPELINE AND THE BOOSTER STATION HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO ADDRESS THE REMOVAL OF ALL AIR/OXYGEN FROM THE PIPELINE AND THE BOOSTER STATION EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO THE EQUIPMENTS RETURN TO SERVICE, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION FOCUSED IN ELIMINATING AIR FROM DEAD LEGS OF PIPING AND EQUIPMENT.

THE PRODUCER WAS TO REMOVE TWO METER RUNS.  THE VALVES AT THE ENDS OF EACH METER RUN HAD BEEN CLOSED AND LOCKED AT SOME EARLIER DATE BY ANR PERSONNEL.  AT THE TIME OF PLANNED FACILITY DISCONNECTION AND REMOVAL, THE PRODUCER PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE METER RUN ISOLATION VALVES WERE LEAKING AND DECIDED TO ISOLATE ADDITIONAL PIPING ON THE PLATFORM IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT NO GAS COULD MIGRATE TO THE MEASUREMENT PIPING.  TO FACILITATE THIS ADDITIONAL ISOLATION ACTIVITY, WHICH WAS NOT PART OF THE PROJECT SCOPE AND HAD NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY ANR MANAGEMENT, PRODUCER PERSONNEL CLOSED VALVES TO GAS SOURCES, OPENED THE PIG TRAP KICKER LINE VALVE, AND THEN OPENED THE 4' PIG TRAP VENT VALVE THROUGH WHICH THIS ISOLATED PIPING WAS EVACUATED.  AS THE PIPING AND PIG TRAP WERE BLOWING DOWN, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PRESSURE IN THE PIG TRAP AND ASSOCIATED PIPING WOULD NOT DROP TO ATMOSPHERIC.  PRODUCER PERSONNEL PRESUMED THAT ONE OF THE VALVES THEY HAD CLOSED TO ISOLATED THE PIPING FROM A GAS SOURCE MUST NOT HAVE COMPLETELY CLOSED.  IT WAS DECIDED TO ATTEMPT TO FURTHER CLOSE THE VALVE.  HOWEVER, RATHER THAN USING THE HAND PUMP TO OPERATE THE VALVE, PRODUCER PERSONNEL USED THE POWER GAS OPERATOR AND MISTAKENLY PARTLY OPENED THE VALVE.  THIS ALLOWED HIGH PRESSURE GAS (APPROXIMATELY 860 PSIG) TO ENTER THE PARTIALLY BLOWN DOWN PIPING WITH A HIGH DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE OPENED VENT VALVE.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE PIG TRAP VENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH WAS MOUNTED AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION ON THE TRAP BOTTLE, INCLUDED A VENT STACK THAT WAS CONFIGURED WITH A 90 DEGREE BEND INTENDED TO VENT GAS AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM.   DUE TO THE SUDDEN INCREASE IN GAS PRESSURE AND FLOW THROUGH THE VENT VALVE ASSEMBLY AND THE RESULTANT HIGH VELOCITY GAS EXITING THE 90 DEGREE VENT STACK, ENOUGH FORCE WAS PRODUCED TO CAUSE THE ENTIRE VENT ASSEMBLY TO FAIL AND DISCONNECT NEAR THE PIG TRAP BOTTLE.  FOLLOWING THE FAILURE, THE VENT VALVE ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN REBUILT AND REINSTALLED ON THE PIG TRAP.  THE SYSTEM WAS THEN PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON JUNE 28, 2014."

THIS MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED ON JULY 11, 2014, THE DAY PREVIOUS TO THE REPORTED INCIDENT.  TO PREVENT THE 8-INCH BLOWDOWN VALVE FROM ACCIDENTALLY OPERATING DURING THIS MAINTENANCE, THE PILOT GAS AND POWER GAS SOURCES TO THE BLOWDOWN VALVE OPERATOR WERE DISABLED BY CLOSING  1/2-INCH VALVES ON THE POWER GAS AND PILOT GAS TUBING LINES AT THE VALVE OPERATOR.

THIS RESULTED IN A LOSS OF PILOT GAS LINE PRESSURE AT THE OPERATOR, ALLOWED POWER GAS TO ACTIVATE THE ESD POPPET VALVE COMPONENT OF THE VALVE OPERATOR, AND RESULTED IN THE OPENING OF THE 8-INCH STATION SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE. THIS BLOWDOWN VALVE REMAINED OPEN UNTIL AN ON-DUTY STATION EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED THE OPEN VALVE AND MANUALLY CLOSED IT AT APPROXIMATELY 3:40 AM CDT.    FOLLOWING CLOSURE OF THE BLOWDOWN VALVE, TRANSCANADA PERSONNEL CALCULATED THE ESTIMATED GAS LOST DURING THE EVENT TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1.84 MMCF, WHICH WOULD HAVE PUT THE EVENT BELOW THE REPORTING THRESHOLD OF 3.0 MMCF AS STATED IN 191.3 DEFINITIONS OF AN 'INCIDENT' (THE EVENT ALSO DID NOT MEET ANY OF THE OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENT CRITERIA IN THE DEFINITION OF AN 'INCIDENT').  HOWEVER, UPON FURTHER REVIEW OF THE EVENT THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, JULY 14, 2014, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE GAS LOSS CALCULATION HAD BEEN MISINTERPRETED, I.E., THE DECIMAL POINT WAS PLACED INCORRECTLY IN THE GAS LOSS RESULT.

MATTHEWS.  THE STATION PROVIDES SERVICE TO A TRANSMISSION LATERAL SERVING THE DEVRO INDUSTRIAL PLANT AS WELL AS THE DOWNSTREAM PORTION OF THE ST. MATTHEWS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE.  THE STATION ITSELF RESIDES IN A PRIVATE EASEMENT WHILE THE PIPELINE THAT FEEDS IT RESIDES IN ROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY.  THE STATION FOOTPRINT IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30' FROM THE HWY 176 TRAVEL LANE.  THE STATION HAD A GUARDRAIL IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE PIPELINE FACILITIES FROM VEHICLE DAMAGE.      ON AUGUST 28, 2014 AT APPROXIMATELY 4:33 AM (AS DETERMINED BY POST-INCIDENT REVIEW OF SCADA LOGS), A DUMP TRUCK LEFT THE ROADWAY AND STRUCK THE VALVE STATION CAUSING A MAJOR LEAK ON THE ST. MATTHEWS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE.  SCE&G'S SCADA SYSTEM REACHED ALARM CONDITIONS AT APPROXIMATELY 4:54 AM, AND SCE&G RECEIVED A CONFIRMING CALL FROM THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTING THE INCIDENT AT APPROXIMATELY 4:58 AM.  COMPANY FIRST RESPONDERS WERE NOTIFIED AND DISPATCHED AT APPROXIMATELY 5:02 AM AND ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 5:57 AM.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AIDED IN CLOSING THE ROAD TO TRAFFIC, EVACUATING NEARBY RESIDENTS WITHIN 500 FT OF THE INCIDENT, AND INFORMING THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THE INCIDENT.  ONE SCHOOL, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES AWAY, ELECTED TO CLOSE FOR THE DAY DUE TO THE DISRUPTION OF TRAFFIC THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ROAD CLOSURE.    WITHIN THE 500 FT RADIUS OF EVACUATION, CONDUCTED BY THE LOCAL EMERGENCY TEAMS, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 8 HOMES.   IN REFERENCE TO PART A QUESTION 18 OF THE INCIDENT REPORT, THE NUMBER OF PERSONS EVACUATED WAS PROVIDED BY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO CONDUCTED THE EVACUATIONS; HOWEVER, FIRE SERVICES PERSONNEL DID NOT HAVE AN EXACT COUNT OF EVACUEES BUT CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED THE NUMBER TO BE 100.   AT APPROXIMATELY 8:15 AM, SCE&G VALVED THE PIPELINE OUT OF SERVICE TO SHUT OFF THE ESCAPING GAS.  ALSO, AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT AND VALVING THE LINE OUT OF SERVICE, TWO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS LOST SERVICE.  SCE&G WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE DOWNSTREAM LINEPACK AND A COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG) TRAILER TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO TWO SMALL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS FEEDING THE TOWNS OF ST. MATTHEWS AND CAMERON.  SCE&G COMPLETED REPAIRS TO THE MAINLINE PORTION OF THE VALVE STATION BY 7:30 PM, REESTABLISHING THE FEED TO THE TOWNS OF ST. MATTHEWS AND CAMERON.  SCE&G COMPLETED THE REMAINING REPAIRS TO THE DEVRO LATERAL TAKE-OFF PORTION OF THE STATION BY 11:30 PM, RESTORING SERVICE TO THE DEVRO PLANT.

DAN STATED THEY FIRST NOTICED THE BUBBLES ABOUT 3:30PM ON 9-13-14. THE BARELY VISIBLE SHEEN COVERED APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET WIDE BY 2600 FEET LONG WITH 50% COVERAGE. THEY REPORTED THE LEAK & SHEEN TO NRC AT 6:10PM, NRC #1095249. TRANSCO WAS INFORMED THAT HELIS HAD SHUT-IN AND BLOWN DOWN THEIR WELLS. THIS LED THEM TO BELIEVE THE BUBBLES WERE POSSIBLY COMING FROM THE TRANSCO 26"" LINE.  HELIS ALSO UTILIZED THE SERVICES OF OIL MOPS(OSRO) TO CONTAIN THE SHEEN AND THE SERVICES OF BLACKWATER DIVERS WHO HAD ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION EARLIER THAT MORNING.    WE (TRANSCO) PLOTTED COORDINATES ON OUR ALIGNMENT SHEETS, BUT IT PLOTTED OUT ABOUT 1500 FEET FROM TRANSCO 26"".  OUR TECHNICIANS, WERE SENT OUT BY HELICOPTER TO FLY OVER LEAK SITE AND LAND AT SS 45 PLATFORM(HELIS OWNED).  AT 11:35AM, OUR TECHNICIAN CALLED WITH DETAILS OF THE SHEEN WHICH WAS VERY LIGHT AND MEASURED 5 MILES LONG AND 300 FEET WIDE WITH ABOUT 30% COVERAGE. OUR TECHNICIAN RELAYED TO US UPDATED COORDINATES TAKEN BY THE HELICOPTER.  HE TOOK A FIELD BOAT TO LEAK SITE AND WAS INFORMED BY BLACKWATER DIVERS THEY SUSPECTED THAT THE BUBBLES WERE COMING FROM TRANSCO 26"" LINE.  AT 1:35PM,  TRANSCO SCHRIEVER OFFICE WAS INFORMED THAT BUBBLES WERE COMING FROM THE TRANSCO 26"" PIPELINE.  HELIS CALLED O'BRIENS AT 12 NOON ON 9-15-14 TO INFORM THEM THAT THE LEAK DID NOT BELONG TO HELIS.  SCHRIEVER OFFICE ASSUMED THE ORIGINAL NRC #1095249 THAT HELIS HAD CALLED IN WOULD ALSO APPLY TO TRANSCO LEAK ON THE 26"" PIPELINE.  AFTER CONFIRMING WITH BUD KLINE AND WITH O'BRIEN'S THAT ANOTHER NRC # WAS NECESSARY,  TOUPS CONTACTED O'BRIEN'S AT 3:13PM AND WILLIAMS (TRANSCO) GAS CONTROL AT 3:20PM.  O'BRIENS CONTACTED NRC AT 3:35PM AND RECEIVED NRC #1095398.  O'BRIEN'S ALSO CONTACTED LA. STATE POLICE AT 3:42PM AND RECEIVED #14-04128.  SCHRIEVER DISTRICT PERSONNEL ISOLATED THE 26"" PIPELINE SEGMENT 5103 AT SHIP SHOAL 70 PLATFORM AND AT DOG LAKE GENERATOR PLATFORM AT 4:22PM. NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUED BETWEEN TRANSCO & HELIS TO UTILIZE THE OSRO (OIL MOPS) AND BLACKWATER DIVERS AS WELL AS THE LIFT BOAT ON LOCATION THE DIVERS WERE USING. TRANSCO WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE OIL MOPS PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT, BUT NOT BLACKWATER DIVERS AND LIFT BOAT. SCHRIEVER THEN REQUESTED OIL MOPS PERSONNEL TO USE ABSORBENT BOOM TO ENCIRCLE THE BUBBLES, CAPTURING ANY SHEENING WITHIN THE BOOM. A DIVE VESSEL THAT WAS BEING USED BY TRANSCO ON ANOTHER JOB, WAS REQUESTED TO RELOCATE TO LEAK LOCATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. INCLEMENT WEATHER CAUSED SOME DELAYS WITH THE PIPELINE BLOWDOWN AND THE REPAIR.    SUMMARY OF LEAK INVESTIGATION & REPAIR OF THE LEAK:  DIVERS WERE SENT DOWN TO THE LEAKING PIPE, THEY PERFORMED A UT SCAN ON ALL SIDES OF THE LEAKING PIPE AND VERIFIED THAT THE THE LEAK WAS NOT EXTERNAL. THE LEAK OCCURRED ON THE LOW POINT OF THE PIPE, NEAR THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.  A CLAMP WAS USED TO REPAIR THE LEAK AND THE LINE WAS GRADUALLY PRESSURED BACK UP TO MAOP ON 9-29-2014 AT 3:15 PM; NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.    THE HISTORY OF THIS GATHERING PIPELINE SYSTEM HAS BEEN THE TRANSPORTATION OF UNPROCESSED UNDEHYDRATED NATURAL GAS SINCE 1990.

THERE WERE NO INJURIES; HOWEVER, THERE WAS ONE SELF-EVACUATION OF A RESIDENT CLOSEST TO THE SITE AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. THE RELEASE OCCURRED IN A RURAL AREA AND WITHIN A PASTURE. THE CLOSEST STRUCTURE INTENDED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY IS ABOUT 500 FEET NORTHWEST (LANDOWNER RESIDENCE). THIS STRUCTURE WAS UNDAMAGED; HOWEVER A BARN LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 221 FEET TO THE NORTHWEST HAD MINOR DAMAGE FROM FLYING DEBRIS. THE RELEASE APPEARED TO HAVE INITIATED BY PIPE MOVEMENT OUT OF THE MECHANICAL DRESSER COUPLINGS. THE PIPE SEGMENT INVOLVED DOES NOT CONTAIN AN HCA. THE PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE WAS 441 PSIG AT THE LOUISBURG 105 GATE; THE MAOP OF THIS SEGMENT IS 475 PSIG. GAS CONTROL ALARMS ACCOMPANIED BY A COINCIDENT CALL FROM JOHNSON COUNTY 911 SET IN MOTION A RESPONSE BY LOCAL EMPLOYEES WHICH HAD THE AFFECTED SEGMENT ISOLATED ON THE UPSTREAM (105 GATE) AND DOWNSTREAM (106 GATE) SIDES BY APPROXIMATELY 11:25 AM. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE FIGHTERS RESPONDED TO THE EVENT AND PERFORMED ADMIRABLY AS THEY SECURED THE INCIDENT SITE AND WORKED COOPERATIVELY WITH LOCAL PEPL EMPLOYEES.    THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT UPDATES THE PART G APPARENT CAUSE BASED ON THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS.   THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT SHOULD BE CATEGORIZED AS A CONSTRUCTION FAILURE. THE PIPE WAS CONSTRUCTED IN 1931 WITH AN OVER BEND AT THE COUPLING THAT EXCEEDED THE COUPLING MANUFACTURER DEFLECTION RECOMMENDATIONS. THE PIPE DISENGAGED AT THE COUPLING DUE TO THAT DEFLECTION EXCEEDANCE COMBINED WITH AN UPWARD COMPONENT FORCE DUE TO INTERNAL PRESSURE. ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS INADEQUATE RESISTIVE FORCES ON THE PIPE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SOIL PROPERTIES DUE TO WATER SATURATION.     ADDITIONAL UPDATES WERE MADE TO PART C, 3; PART D - COSTS 7B, AND 7D; PART E 2A; AND PART G - CAUSE.

THIS INCIDENT REPORT WAS NOT FILED WITHIN THE 30 DAYS OF THE LEAK DISCOVERY AS IT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO MEET THE REPORTABLE INCIDENT CRITERIA AT THAT TIME.  ONCE ACCESS TO THE SITE IMPROVED, A BETTER ESTIMATE FOR REPAIR WAS ESTABLISHED.  THE NEW COST ESTIMATE IS MORE THAN $50,000 SO THIS INCIDENT REPORT IS BEING FILED.  THIS INCIDENT REPORT IS MISSING INFORMATION THAT CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED ONCE THE LEAK IS ACCESSED AND REPAIRED.  IT WILL BE UPDATED ONCE THE PIPE AND THE LEAK HAVE BEEN EVALUATED.      UPDATE:  THE LEAK WAS FINALLY ACCESSIBLE ON DECEMBER 8TH, 2014.  EXCAVATION VIA HYDROVAC EXPOSED THE PIPELINE AND THE AREA OF THE LEAK.  A 0.100' PIN HOLE WAS LOCATED AT THE 7 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE PIPE.  THE 17.57 MILE ISOLATED SECTION OF PIPELINE WAS BLOWN DOWN AND CONTRACTOR COMPLETED EXCAVATION ON DECEMBER 9TH, 2014.  APPROXIMATELY 115' OF THE PIPELINE WAS CUT OUT ON DECEMBER 10TH, 2014 AND NEW 12.75' OD X-42 0.250' WT FBE ERW PIPE WAS INSTALLED ON DECEMBER 10TH AND 11TH.  THE PIPELINE WAS PURGED, PRESSURED UP AND RETURNED TO SERVICE ON DECEMBER 12TH, 2014 AT APPROXIMATELY 2:30PM.    THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS LOCALIZED EXTERNAL CORROSION."

HOFFMAN,MANAGER,(304)357-2548,mikehoffman@cpg.com,"ON OCTOBER 15, 2014, A CONTRACTOR EMPLOYED BY COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION, LLC (COLUMBIA) WAS WORKING ON A NEAR-BY PROJECT, WHEN HE DETECTED THE ODOR OF NATURAL GAS.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS, A CASING VENT WAS TESTED FOR EVIDENCE OF A NON-HAZARDOUS NATURAL GAS LEAK INSIDE A CASING.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED TO ASSIST IN SECURING THE SITE PENDING FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND NECESSARY SAFETY MEASURES.  THE SEGMENT WAS ISOLATED BY COLUMBIA PERSONNEL AND THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN.  HENCE, THE SITE WAS SECURED.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, A DECISION WAS MADE TO REPLACE THE CASING AND THE PIPE WITH A PIPE.   UPON REMOVAL OF THE PIPE, AN EXTERNAL CORROSION PIT WITH 100 PERCENT WALL PENETRATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE UNINTENDED NATURAL GAS RELEASE. THE CORROSION PIT WAS APPROXIMATELY 3.75 INCHES INSIDE OF THE NORTH END OF THE CASING AT THE 5 O'CLOCK POSITION WHEN FACING NORTH. THE PIT WAS AT A LOCATION OF DAMAGED OR MISSING COATING.  THE DAMAGED COATING WAS LOCATED UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR.  BOTH RUBBER ISOLATORS AND WOODEN CENTRALIZERS WERE OBSERVED TO BE IN USE UPON REMOVAL OF THE CASING. HOWEVER, THE CARRIER PIPE WAS NOT CENTERED THROUGH THE CASING. WATER MARKS WERE OBSERVED ON BOTH THE CARRIER PIPE AND ON THE CASING, INDICATING THAT THE CASING SEALS HAD BEEN COMPROMISED AND, AT TIMES, WATER HAD BEEN PRESENT IN THE ANNULAR SPACE. WATER FLOWED OUT OF THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CASING WHEN THE SOUTH SIDE CASING SEAL WAS EXPOSED.  NO KNOWN SOIL CONDITIONS OR MEASURED POTENTIAL READINGS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION OR CATHODIC PROTECTION INTERFERENCE WERE OBSERVED.  1. THE EXTERNAL CORROSION PIT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF CORROSION AT THE SITE OF COATING DAMAGE UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CASING.  2. THE COATING DAMAGE LIKELY OCCURRED DURING INSTALLATION OF THE CASING OR DURING A SUBSEQUENT EXCAVATION OF THE CASING ENDS.  THE WOODEN CENTRALIZERS CAUSED AND/OR EXACERBATED THE COATING DAMAGE.  3. THE PLACEMENT OF THE CASING ISOLATOR OVER THE AREA OF DAMAGED COATING DID NOT ISOLATE THE EXPOSED STEEL FROM EVENTUAL ELECTROLYTE INTRUSION.  WITH WATER BEING PRESENT BETWEEN THE CASING SEAL AND THE PIPE, ATMOSPHERIC AND CREVICE CORROSION PITTED THE PIPE TO CAUSE THE LEAK. 4. THE INTRODUCTION OF WATER AS AN ELECTROLYTE TO THE EXPOSED STEEL CREATED A LOCALIZED CORROSION CELL UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR.  EXTERNAL CORROSION OCCURRED WHEN THE NON-LEVEL CASING FILLED WITH WATER COMPLETELY TO THE NORTH (HIGH) SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION OCCURRED WHEN THE CASING WAS NOT COMPLETELY FILLED.  5. DURING THE TIME WHEN THE CASING WAS COMPLETELY FILLED WITH WATER, THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR SHIELDED THE EXPOSED STEEL FROM CATHODIC PROTECTION CURRENT THAT COULD HAVE MITIGATED THE CORROSION CELL DURING THAT TIME.  DURING THE TIME WHEN ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION WAS OCCURRING, ONLY RE-COATING THE EXPOSED STEEL OR MAINTAINING DRY CONDITIONS INSIDE THE CASING COULD HAVE MITIGATED THE CORROSION CELL.  KEY LESSONS LEARNED/CORRECTIVE MEASURES: 1) THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF THE CORROSION PIT THAT CAUSED THE LEAK MAKES IT DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO DETECT DURING TYPICAL, NON-EXCAVATION CASING POTENTIAL OR SHORT TESTS.  BECAUSE THE CORROSION OCCURRED IN AN ELECTRICALLY SHIELDED AREA, THE ONLY RELIABLE METHOD FOR DETECTION IS THE USE OF IN-LINE INSPECTION TOOLS.  LINE R-701-N IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING RECONFIGURED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RUNNING IN-LINE INSPECTION TOOLS IN THE FUTURE.  2) THERE WERE NO INDICATORS FOR A LOW PIPE-TO-SOIL POTENTIAL MEASUREMENTS FOR THE PIPELINE IN THE AREA GOING BACK TO 2008.  LIKEWISE, NO CASING-TO-SOIL POTENTIAL MEASUREMENTS INDICATED SHORT TESTING WAS NEEDED.  3) FILLING THE ANNULAR SPACE BETWEEN THE CARRIER PIPE AND THE CASING WITH A DIELECTRIC MATERIAL REMOVES THE CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT AND CAN PREVENT CORROSION FROM OCCURRING.  FILLING OF THIS CASING COULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS LEAK."

UPDATE APRIL 10, 2015 - PIPE WAS SENT TO LAB FOR METALLUGIC REVIEW, COMPLETED REPORT RECEIVED APRIL 2, 2015. STRESS ENGINEERING'S TEST RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: VISUAL, METALLOGRAPHIC, AND FRACTOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF THE SAMPLE INDICATED THAT CRACKS INITIATED ON THE OUTSIDE SURFACE OF THE PIPE. THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CRACKS INCLUDED CLOSELY-SPACED CRACKS IN COLONIES, TRANSGRANULAR AND BRANCHED GROWTH PATH, CRESCENT-SHAPED CRACKS PARTIALLY COVERED WITH MAGNETITE, AND ENLARGEMENT OF THE CRACKS AT THE OUTSIDE SURFACE DUE TO CORROSION. THESE FEATURES SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS LEAK WAS THE RESULT OF NEAR-NEUTRAL PH STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC). THESE CRACKS WERE ALIGNED PERPENDICULAR TO THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS OF THE PIPE AT THE EXTRADOS OF AN OVER-BEND AND WERE CREATED BY BENDING LOADS IN THE PIPELINE. THE FACT THAT THE FINAL FAILURE WAS DUE TO DUCTILE OVERLOAD ALSO SUPPORTS THE ASSERTION THAT THE LONGITUDINAL STRESSES WERE SIGNIFICANT AT THIS LOCATION. FURTHER, THE UPWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PIPE AFTER IT WAS CUT IN THE DITCH DURING EXCAVATION IS CONFORMATION OF THIS CONCLUSION. STRESS ENGINEERING DID NOT OBSERVE ANY MATERIAL FLAWS OR DEFECTS IN THE SAMPLE MATERIAL. THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE SAMPLE IS TYPICAL FOR A CARBON-STEEL PIPE MATERIAL. THE PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIAL ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF API 5LX (1968) FOR GRADE X60 AND ARE NOT BELIEVED TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE.    9/23/2015 ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON THE ILI DATA TO LOOK FOR SIMILAR CONDITIONS IN THE LINE SEGMENT AND THESE AREAS WERE OVERLAID WITH CIS DATA.  THREE (3) LOCATIONS WERE SELECTED TO INVESTIGATE, THEY WILL DUG PRIOR TO THE END OF OCTOBER."

THE CREW OF THIS BOAT CONTACTED THE COAST GUARD, WHO IN TURN CONTACTED COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION, LLC (COLUMBIA) TO INVESTIGATE IF THE SUBJECT BUBBLES WERE EMANATING FROM A NEAR-BY LINE THAT RUNS IN THIS AREA. COLUMBIA OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THIS REPORTED LEAK.  AFTER CLOSING THE TWO MAINLINE VALVES THAT ARE WITHIN THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT OF THE LINE, BUBBLES KEPT SURFACING.  SAMPLES OF THE RELEASED MATERIAL WERE COLLECTED AND SENT TO THE LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS.  THE LINE PRESSURE WAS RESTRICTED TO ABOUT 125 PSIG TO ENSURE THAT THE RELEASED BUBBLES WERE IDENTIFIABLE FOR REPAIRS, IF THE LINE TURNS OUT TO BE COLUMBIA'S.  THEREAFTER, THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE WHERE PIPELINE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MANNED THE TWO MAINLINE VALVES OVERNIGHT, MONITORING LINE PRESSURE VIA DIGITAL PRESSURE GAUGES.   THE FOLLOWING DAY (NOVEMBER 17, 2014), THE LINE RELEASING BUBBLES WAS DECLARED AS COLUMBIA OWNED, OPERATED AND MAINTAINED LINE.  THEN A REPORT TO THE NRC WAS MADE ON THAT MORNING DUE TO THE EXPECTED REPAIR COSTS THAT WILL EXCEED $50,000.  THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF MATERIAL DID NOT EXCEED 3,000 MCF.  NO EVIDENCE OF SHEEN WAS NOTED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE RELEASE FOR MATERIAL ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATERWAY.  AFTER THE CAUSE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED, IT WAS DETERMINED THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY AN ANCHOR BEING DROPPED AND DRAGGED ACROSS THE PIPELINE. THE THIRD PARTY DAMAGE CONSISTED OF TWO DENTS AND ONE GOUGE AREA. THE GOUGE AREA HAD A PINHOLE LEAK.  THE DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN REPAIRED BUT HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO SERVICE SINCE THE DATE OF THE INCIDENT."

UPON DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK LOCATION, ANR DECIDED TO ISOLATE THE PIPELINE SEGMENT, REDUCE THE PRESSURE ON THE LINE, AND PERFORM ADDITIONAL TESTING AND ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE REPAIR.      ON 13 DECEMBER, SUBSEA VALVE 733-1A-2 LOCATED AT EUGENE ISLAND BLOCK 63 (EI-63) WAS CLOSED,  ISOLATING THE 733 PIPELINE BETWEEN EI-63  AND ANR'S PATTERSON COMPRESSOR STATION LOCATED  IN ST. MARY PARISH, LOUISIANA.  ADDITIONALLY, THE PRODUCER, CASTEX, WAS SHUT-IN AND THE VALVE WAS CLOSED AT EUGENE ISLAND BLOCK 18.  PRESSURE ON THE 733 LINE WAS REDUCED FROM APPROXIMATELY 800 PSIG TO 400 PSIG AND FLARED AT THE PATTERSON COMPRESSOR STATION.      FOLLOWING THE REDUCTION IN PRESSURE, TIME OF FLIGHT DIFFRACTION NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING (NDT) WAS CONDUCTED ON 15 DECEMBER 2014 TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LOCATION OF LEAK.   THE AREA INSPECTED INCLUDED ONE FOOT UPSTREAM AND ONE FOOT DOWNSTREAM OF THE ANOMALY AREA.  TESTING INDICATED A SMALL DEFECT LOCATED WITHIN THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM WITH NO INDICATION OF CRACKS OR LACK OF FUSION.      ON 18 DECEMBER AT 05:00 CST, A PLIDCO BOLT-ON CLAMP WAS SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED OVER THE LEAK LOCATION BY QUALIFIED CONTRACT EMPLOYEES.  THE CLAMP IS CONSIDERED A PERMANENT REPAIR.  FOLLOWING THE INSTALLATION OF THE CLAMP, PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS INCREASED, THE PRODUCER VALVE AT EI-18 WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME FLOWING, AND THE SUBSEA VALVE AT EI-63 WILL BE REOPENED WHEN IT CAN BE SAFELY ACCESSED.  THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF FURTHER LEAKAGE AT THE REPAIR LOCATION."

GIVEN ITS PROXIMITY TO A PRODUCER SATELLITE FACILITY WE BELIEVED IT TO BE THEIR ISSUE, HOWEVER UPON HAVING THE COORDINATES PLOTTED OUT IT LOOKED TO BE ON OUR 26"" LINE. WE STARTED THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE SEGMENT BETWEEN SMI 33 AND VR 149 WHILE WE SOURCED A DSV TO INVESTIGATE FOR US. WE SPOKE TO THE USCG THE PREVIOUS EVENING ABOUT THIS AND JUST UPDATED THEM, AS WELL AS NOTIFYING THE NRC.  12.15.14, OUR FLIGHT REPORTED THAT THE LEAK AND ASSOCIATED SHEEN WERE AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WITH NO APPRECIABLE CHANGE. WE CONTINUED TO DISCUSS OPTIONS WITH DSV PROVIDERS. PRESSURE MONITORING WAS ONGOING WITH LITTLE DEVIATION NOTED. THE USCG WAS UPDATED AS TO STATUS.  12.16.14, WE LOCATED A DSV. THE SHEEN WAS STILL PRESENT BUT ONLY 1/4 MILE LONG AND WAS ENCOUNTERING A CHANGING CURRENT AND CHOPPY SEAS. WE GAVE THE USCG THEIR DAILY UPDATE.  12.17.14, THE DSV MADE IT TO THE SITE. INITIAL REPORT WAS THAT THEY LOCATED THE LEAK SOURCE VIA PROBE WITH APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET OF COVER. THEY CONFIRMED THE PIPE SIZE AS OUR 26'. THERE WAS NO REPORTED CHANGE TO THE LEAK ITSELF AT THE TIME.  12.18.14, OVERNIGHT WE WERE ABLE TO LOWER THE LINE PRESSURE AND BEGAN REMOVING CONCRETE AND MASTIC IN THE EARLY HOURS. IT APPEARED AT THE TIME TO BE A PIN HOLE LEAK. DIVERS CONTINUED TO CLEAN UP THE AREA TO OBTAIN THE VARIOUS UT AND CP READINGS NEEDED.    12.19.14, WE COMPLETED ALL PREP WORK ON THE PIPELINE AND CONFIRMED THAT A LEAK CLAMP WOULD BE OUR REPAIR METHOD. DUE TO THE INCREASING SEAS AND THE RISK OF A VESSEL TO VESSEL TRANSFER OF THE CLAMP, THE DSV WENT TO DOCK TO PICK UP THE CLAMP AND EQUIPMENT.  12.21.14, THE CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND ALL LEAK CHECKS WENT WELL. WE WERE UNABLE TO FLY TO ALLOW PRODUCERS BACK ON AND RETURN THE LINE TO NORMAL SERVICE DUE TO WEATHER.  12.22.14, WEATHER FINALLY CLEARED UP. WE MADE AN OVER FLIGHT TO THE SMI 33 FACILITY, SEEING NO SIGNS OF LEAKAGE WHILE IN ROUTE. THE SMI 33 FACILITY WAS THEN PLACED INTO NORMAL SERVICE. THE HELICOPTER MADE STOPS AT THE LOCKED PRODUCER FACILITIES AND PLACED THEM IN NORMAL OPERATIONS."

GAS WAS OBSERVED BUBBLING UP AROUND THE NECK OF THE BELOW GRADE 30-INCH BLOCK VALVE AND CONDENSATE WAS OBSERVED AT THE GROUND SURFACE OF THE VALVE WITHIN THE VALVE YARD.  INITIAL CLEANUP ACTIONS TO CONTAIN CONDENSATE INCLUDED DISPATCHING A VACUUM TRUCK AND THE DEPLOYMENT ABSORBENT PADS AND BOOM.  THE SITE WAS MONITORED DAILY WITH ADDITIONAL ABSORBENT MATERIALS DEPLOYED AS NECESSARY.    ON 12 JANUARY, A FIELD TECHNICIAN REPORTED THAT SHEEN HAD MIGRATED FROM THE VALVE YARD TO ADJACENT  PROPERTY OUTSIDE OF THE YARD VALVE FENCING CREATING SHEEN ON THE GROUND AND IN STANDING WATER.  A TRANSCANADA ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST REPORTED THE RELEASE TO LOUISIANA STATE POLICE (LSP), INCIDENT #15-00155, AS A RELEASE OF CONDENSATE FROM THE VALVE SITE.      AFTER INVESTIGATING AND EVALUATING OPTIONS TO REPAIR THE VALVE, IT WAS DECIDED TO ISOLATE THE 767 LATERAL FROM WEST CAMERON 171 TO THE GRAND CHENIER LIQUID HANDLING FACILITY AND REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO ALLOW FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  ON 13 JANUARY, THE PIPELINE SECTION WAS ISOLATED AND THE LINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED BY FLARED BLOW DOWN AT GRAND CHENIER LIQUID HANDLING FACILITY.    PRESSURE REDUCTION AND FLARING CONTINUED UNTIL 19 JANUARY WHEN LINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION OF THE LEAK.  TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE VALVE AND FURTHER INVESTIGATE, SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AND CONTAINERIZED ONSITE AND APPROVAL IS PENDING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL.  ADDITIONALLY, IMPACTED WATER RECOVERED FROM THE EXCAVATION HAS BEEN CONTAINERIZED FOR DISPOSAL.    FOLLOWING THE EXCAVATION AND INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS THE RESULT OF A PRIMARY STEM SEAL FAILURE.  THE PRIMARY STEM SEAL WAS REPLACED ON VALVE 767-3-10 WITH THE REPAIRS COMPLETED ON 28 JANUARY.  FOLLOWING THE REPAIR, A PURGE AND LOAD PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE 767 LATERAL WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 2 FEBRUARY 2015.  IMPACTED SOIL AND WATER WILL REMAIN CONTAINERIZED AT THE SITE UNTIL APPROVED FOR TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL.    A DETERMINATION ON WHY THE STEM SEAL FAILED IS MOST LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO A MISALIGNMENT OR MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  THE FAILED O-RING SEAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE VALVE AND REPLACED WITH A NEW O-RING SEAL, WHICH REPAIRED THE LEAK AND ALLOWED THE LINE TO BE PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE.    INITIAL ESTIMATES FOR THE REPAIR AND REMEDIATION OF THE VALVE AND VALVE SITE DID NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO REPORT THE INCIDENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC).  FOLLOWING THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINING ESTIMATES FOR THE VALVE REPAIR, THE TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF IMPACTED SOIL AND WATER, AND REMEDIATION OF THE SITE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ESTIMATED REPAIR AND REMEDIATION FOR THE VALVE AND VALVE SITE BEGAN TO APPROACH AND COULD EXCEED $50,000 IN TOTAL COSTS.  UPON MAKING THIS DETERMINATION ON 27 JANUARY, TRANSCANADA REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE NRC (REPORT # 1106719) AND CONTACTED PHMSA SOUTHWEST REGIONAL.     FOLLOWING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE O-RING AND REPAIR OF THE VALVE, THE SITE WAS RESTORED AND REMEDIATED IN ACCORDANCE REGULATIONS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (LDEQ) AND THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (USEPA).  LIQUID PRODUCT ALONG WITH IMPACTED WATER AND SOIL WAS RECOVERED AND TRANSPORTED FOR PROPER DISPOSAL AND THE SITE HAS BEEN RESTORED."

THE 42"" PIPELINE WAS OPERATING AT 1296 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, WITH AN ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE (MAOP) OF 1480 PSIG.  THERE WAS NO FIRE, EXPLOSION, INJURY/DEATH, OR MAJOR PRIVATE PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUPTURE.  FIFTY FAMILIES WERE EVACUATED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.    THE FIRST SCADA SAFETY RELATED LINE BREAK ALARM FOR THE MEXICO COMPRESSOR STATION WAS RECEIVED IN THE OPERATIONAL CONTROL CENTER (OCC) AT 17:56 CST.  THE CONTROLLER IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE ON-CALL STATION OPERATOR AT MEXICO COMPRESSOR STATION TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS AN ISSUE AT THE STATION.  THE VALVE DOWNSTREAM OF THE RUPTURE SITE (MLV 65) CLOSED IMMEDIATELY UPON SENSING THE PRESSURE DROP.  A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BOWLING GREEN FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTACTED OCC AT 18:15 CST, WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A CALL FROM THE PIKE COUNTY SHERIFF AT 18:20 CST TO COMMUNICATE THEIR ARRIVAL ON SITE.  AT 18:30 CST THE CONTROLLER SPOKE WITH LOCAL FIELD OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WHO WERE IN ROUTE TO THE SITE.  TALLGRASS FIELD OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AT 19:40 CST, MET WITH THE LOCAL INCIDENT COMMANDER, AND AT THAT TIME CONFIRMED THE RUPTURE.  FIELD OPERATIONS SUPERVISED THE BLOWDOWN OF GAS UNTIL IT WAS SAFE TO APPROACH THE RUPTURE SITE IN PREPARATION FOR THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION.  AT 0:52 CST EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITIES CONCLUDED AND THE SITE WAS DEEMED SECURE.  INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND CLEAN-UP BEGAN THE MORNING OF JANUARY 30, 2015.      THE FIELD INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT A WELD.  INCLUDED ARE BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PIPE CHARACTERISTICS:  - UPSTREAM: X70, WT. 0.74, ARO   - DOWNSTREAM: X80, WT. 0.486, FBE   - 0.740"" BEVEL WAS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASME B31.8 ANNEX I AND SHOWED EVIDENCE OF GOOD WORKMANSHIP    SUBSEQUENT TO THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS DISCUSSION, AND WITH AGREEMENT FROM ALL PARTIES INVOLVED, IT WAS DEEMED THAT THE GIRTH WELD RUPTURE WAS AN OVERLOAD FAILURE CAUSED BY AXIAL STRESS THAT EXCEEDED THE CROSS SECTION TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE CRACK INITIATION LOCATION.  THIS DETERMINATION IS SUPPORTED BY CRACK CHARACTERISTICS, METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, POTENTIAL FAILURE MODES AND OBSERVATION OF THE PIPE GEOMETRY RESULTING FROM THE RUPTURE.  THE RCA IDENTIFIED FIVE AXIAL LOAD INDUCING VARIABLES THAT LIKELY LEAD TO THE EXCEEDANCE OF THE CROSS SECTION TENSILE STRENGTH, HOWEVER, NO SINGLE VARIABLE CAN BE BLAMED FOR THE OVERALL CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE. THE FIVE PREDOMINATE AXIAL LOAD INDUCING VARIABLES ARE AS FOLLOWS: PIPELINE SETTLEMENT, PIPELINE MISALIGNMENT, TEMPERATURE STRESSES, INTERNAL PRESSURE, AND CONSTRUCTION FORCES."

THE SEGMENT FROM VALVE SECTION 66-1 TO 67-1 WAS SECURED AND PROMPTLY BLOWN DOWN TO ISOLATE THE LEAK AND INITIATE REPAIRS.   THE IMPACTED SEGMENT OF PIPE WAS SENT OFF FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS ON MARCH 6, 2015 AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE FRACTURE INITIATED FROM MULTIPLE ORIGINS ON THE INSIDE SURFACE OF THE PIPE AT THE PEAK OF THE WRINKLE. THE FRACTURE MODE WAS BRITTLE (QUASI-CLEAVAGE). THE FRACTURE SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF FATIGUE AND THE FRACTURE LOCATION WAS ON THE TOP OF A RIDGE CONTAINING TWO 1° SAG WRINKLE BENDS.  CONSTRUCTION RECORDS INDICATE THE WRINKLE BENDS WERE COLD-FORMED AND COLD WORK COULD REDUCE DUCTILITY. THE COLD-FORMED REGION IS ALSO POTENTIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO STRAIN-AGING, WHICH COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO LOWER DUCTILITY. THESE FACTORS COULD INCREASE THE DUCTILE TO BRITTLE TRANSITION TEMPERATURE OF THE WRINKLE BEND COMPARED TO THE PIPE BODY.    RESULTS OF THE ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE PRIMARY METALLURGICAL FAILURE MECHANISM WAS BRITTLE FRACTURE AND THAT THE CRACK APPEARS TO HAVE FAILED BY TENSILE OVERLOAD. TGP WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF EACH OF THE TENSILE FORCES, BUT THE TENSILE OVERLOAD DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A RESULT OF THIRD PARTY DAMAGE OR OBSERVABLE LAND MOVEMENT.  IN ADDITION THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS ARE PRESENTED:    1. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THE FAILURE RESULTED FROM INSERVICE FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH OR STRESS CORROSION CRACKING.  2. THE MAOP WAS NOT EXCEEDED AND OVERPRESSURE WAS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE.  3. INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL CORROSION WAS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR."

TRANSCANADA EMPLOYEES FROM THE GLGT ST. VINCENT COMPRESSOR STATION NEAR ST. VINCENT, MINNESOTA, RESPONDED TO THE REPORT AND ARRIVED AT THE MLV SITE AT 1:20 PM CDT.  WHEN EMPLOYEES ARRIVED AT THE MLV SITE, THEY OBSERVED THE VALVE SITE TO BE PARTIALLY FLOODED AND GAS BUBBLES TO BE EMANATING FROM NEAR THE BASE OF THE UPSTREAM 20-INCH BLOWDOWN VALVE (1-2-2Y) ON THE 200 LINE PIPELINE.  USE OF A GAS DETECTOR REVEALED LOW LEVELS (APPROXIMATELY 10% LEL) OF GAS NEAR THE LEAK SITE.  THE UPSTREAM  PIPELINE SECTION BETWEEN MLV 1-1-2  TO MLV 1-2-2 WAS THEN SHUT IN AND ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM.  AFTER PUMPING THE FLOODWATER FROM THE VALVE SITE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS ORIGINATING FROM A FILLET WELD ON A 2-INCH WELD-O-LET THAT CONNECTED A 2-INCH POWER GAS LINE TO THE 20-INCH BLOWDOWN RISER.  THE UPSTREAM PIPELINE SECTION WAS THEN BLOWN DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.      THIS POWER GAS LINE WAS CONNECTED TO THE RISER AT GROUND LEVEL.  BECAUSE THIS CONNECTION WAS SITUATED AT GROUND LEVEL, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT OVER TIME FROST HEAVE PLACED STRESSES ON THE POWER GAS LINE, EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A CRACK ON THE LOWER SIDE OF THE SUBJECT  FILLET WELD AND THE EVENTUAL  LEAK.  BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, THE POWER GAS CONNECTION TO THE DOWNSTREAM BLOWDOWN RISER WAS ALSO INSPECTED, WHICH REVEALED THE COATING TO BE CRACKED ON THE SIMILAR FILLET WELD AS THE UPSTREAM LOCATION.  NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF THIS WELD REVEALED THAT THE WELD WAS NOT CRACKED.  NONE-THE-LESS, BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM POWER GAS CONNECTIONS WOULD BE REPLACED.  AT THIS POINT, THE DOWNSTREAM PIPELINE SECTION BETWEEN MLV 1-2-2 AND MLV 1-3-2 WAS SHUT IN, ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM, AND BLOWN DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.     IN ADDITION TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER GAS PIPING, SECTIONS OF BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM 20-INCH RISERS WERE REPLACED BECAUSE  THE POWER GAS CONNECTIONS WERE RELOCATED TO MORE SUITABLE LOCATIONS ON THE FACILITY PIPING, MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF ANY FUTURE FROST HEAVE ACTIVITY.  REPAIR ACTIVITIES WERE COMPLETED AND THE FACILITIES PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON MAY 14, 2015."

THE SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:    - THE HOT TAP FITTING LEAKED AT THE TOE OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL FILLET WELD JOINING THE FITTING TO THE IN-SERVICE PIPE.    - THE LEAK WAS DUE TO A HYDROGEN CRACK AT THE TOE OF THE WELD.    - THE UNUSUALLY HIGH CARBON EQUIVALENT OF THE IN-SERVICE PIPE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CRACKING.    THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THE UNUSUALLY HIGH CARBON EQUIVALENT OF THE IN-SERVICE PIPE AS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CRACKING.  A REVIEW OF AVAILABLE RECORDS WAS COMPLETED FOLLOWING THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION TO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER SEGMENTS ON THE SOUTH MAIN LOOP LINE, WITH SAME VINTAGE OF PIPE AND TAPS, THAT MAY EXIST AND REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR MONITORING.  FROM A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE RECORDS, NO OTHER HOT-TAPS ON PIPE CONTAINING A HIGH CARBON EQUIVALENT WERE IDENTIFIED.  FROM THIS REVIEW, SNG DETERMINED THAT OTHER TAPS OR CONNECTIONS WERE EITHER WELD-IN FITTINGS, WHICH ARE NOT AS PRONE TO HYDROGEN CRACKING, OR WERE INSTALLED ON A DIFFERENT VINTAGE OF PIPE."

SSC GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A SECOND CALL AT 15:20 FROM LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS NOTIFYING THEM OF THE BLOWING GAS.  SSC OPERATIONS WERE DISPATCHED AT 15:23 PM.  THE SSC COMMUNICATIONS TECHNICIAN ARRIVED, AT WELDA STATION, AT 15:51 PM AND WAS NOTIFIED TO REMAIN OUTSIDE THE FACILITY SINCE THEY WERE NOT QUALIFIED TO SHUT-IN THE BLOWING GAS.  SSC OPERATIONS ARRIVED ONSITE AT 16:13 PM AND HAD THE STATION SHUT IN AT 16:43 PM.    IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE STATION HAD LOST COMMUNICATIONS DUE TO A POWER SURGE WHICH TRIP BREAKERS AT THE STATION INCLUDING THE BATTERY CHARGER.  ONCE BATTERY BACK-UP DEPLETED ITS POWER THE STATION ESD.  DURING THE ESD TWO GATES REMAINED OPEN BECAUSE OF DEBRIS IN THE ESD SIGNAL LINE THAT MADE ITS WAY TO THE POPPET BOCK, CAUSING EXCESSIVE BLOWING GAS FROM THE MAINLINE."

AN AUDIBLE RELEASE OF GAS WAS DISCOVERED BY THE THIRD PARTY PRODUCER EMANATING FROM BENEATH A RISER CLAMP AND REPORTED TO TRANSCANADA/ANR PIPELINE COMPANY (ANR), OPERATOR FOR TCO.  THE LEAK WAS LOCATED ABOVE THE WATER LINE ON THE PIPELINE RISER NEAR MILEPOST 0 ON THE 757 12' TRANSMISSION LINE ON A PLATFORM OWNED BY ENERGY XXI (28.45374, -91.456405).      THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER ON 15 MAY 2015 AT 18:08 CDT (REPORT #116658).  FOLLOWING THE REPORT OF THE INCIDENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, ANR MAINTAINED CONTACT AND UPDATED U.S. COAST GUARD, BSEE, AND PHMSA.    FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY LEAK, THE 10.83 MILE PIPELINE SECTION WAS ISOLATED AT 09:30 CDT ON 16 MAY 2015 FROM EI259 TO EUGENE ISLAND 231.  THE PIPELINE WAS ATTEMPTED TO BE BLOWN DOWN BEGINNING ON 16 MAY, WHEN PROCESS WATER WAS DISCOVERED IN THE PIPELINE.  DURING THE BLOW DOWN, THE WATER FROM THE PIPELINE WAS PROCESSED BY A VENT SCRUBBER AND STORED IN TANKS AT THE PLATFORM ON EI259.  ADDITIONALLY, A GAS BUSTER WAS USED TO FURTHER REDUCE THE PRESSURE ON THE PIPELINE AND REMOVE PROCESS WATER.      ON 18 MAY 2015 AT 06:45, A PIPELINE TECHNICIAN OBSERVED THE PRESENCE OF SHEEN ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FROM LEAK LOCATION.   AN ADDITIONAL NRC REPORT WAS FILED ON 18 MAY 2015 AT (NRC REPORT #1116799).  LOCATION AND AREA OF THE SHEEN WAS MONITORED UNTIL THE LEAKING CEASED ON 21 MAY 2015.    ON 24 MAY 2015, VENTING WAS COMPLETED, THE LINE WAS PURGED WITH NITROGEN, AND PREPARATIONS WERE MADE TO REPAIR THE LINE.     FOLLOWING VENTING OF THE LINE, THE CLAMP ON THE PIPELINE RISER WAS REMOVED AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION (MAG PARTICLE) WAS PERFORMED ON THE LEAK AREA.  ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY PITTING ATTRIBUTED TO EXTERNAL CORROSION.    ON 25 MAY 2015, AN EXTERNAL WELD-ON SPLIT SLEEVE REPAIR CLAMP WAS SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED ONTO THE PIPELINE TO REPAIR THE LEAK LOCATION.  THE PIPELINE WAS RE-COATED WITH CARBO-MASTIC EPOXY PAINT AND THE RISER CLAMP WAS REINSTALLED.    IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE PIPELINE WAS PLACE RETURNED TO SERVICE"

THE FAULTY VALVE WAS ISOLATED AND WAS NOT RETURNED BACK INTO SERVICE UNTIL AN INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED TO ENSURE THAT THAT THE SAME HARDWARE ERROR WILL NOT TRIGGER ANOTHER EVENT.  THE ESD SYSTEM WAS RETURNED BACK INTO SERVICE ON JUNE 12, 2015.  DURING THIS TIME, THE CS WAS MANNED.  THE KEY LESSONS IDENTIFIED FROM THIS INCIDENT WAS THAT COLUMBIA PERSONNEL TO ASSURE QUARTER TURN VALVES ARE IN THE OPEN POSITION AFTER ANY VALVE MAINTENANCE IS PERFORMED AND TO PERIODICALLY CHECK THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT AREA FOR ANY FUTURE SIGNS OF TAMPERING OR EVIDENCE OF RODENTS.  INITIAL INCIDENT REPORT WAS SUBMITTED ON JUNE 18, 2015"

THE PIPELINE, WHICH HAS AN MAOP OF 650 PSIG, IS 24-INCHES OD, X52 GRADE, WITH A NOMINAL WALL THICKNESS OF 0.250 INCHES. THE ELECTRONIC FLASH WELDED PIPE WAS MANUFACTURED BY AO SMITH AND INSTALLED IN 1950. FLOW IN THE PIPELINE IS SEASONALLY BI-DIRECTIONAL AND WAS STATIC AT A PRESSURE OF 634 PSI (58% SMYS BASED ON NOMINAL PROPERTIES) AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE. GAS RELEASED FROM THE FAILURE LOCATION DID NOT IGNITE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, FATALITIES OR DAMAGE TO SURROUNDING STRUCTURES OR THE ENVIRONMENT.    INVESTIGATIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE INCIDENT REVEALED THAT A FAILURE OF THE WAX-TYPE COATING APPLIED DURING ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENTUAL FORMATION OF TRANSGRANULAR STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC), ALSO KNOW AS NEAR NEUTRAL PH SCC, IN THE PIPE, WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE PIPELINE FAILURE. THUS, THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS THE NEAR NEUTRAL PH SCC, AS DOCUMENTED BY A THIRD-PARTY METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. AND THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE SCC ON THE RUPTURED PIPE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE COATING THAT FAILED TO PERFORM ITS INTENDED PURPOSE OF ELIMINATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENT REQUIRED FOR TRANSGRANULAR SCC TO INITIATE AND PROPAGATE.    CONCURRENT TO THE ROOT CAUSE FAILURE INVESTIGATION, WHICH INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE RESPONSE OF OPERATIONS AND GAS CONTROL PERSONNEL DURING THE EVENT, REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE 8250 LINE, INCLUDING SUBSEQUENT MULTIPLE PRESSURE TESTS TO ASSURE PIPELINE FACILITY INTEGRITY AND SAFETY."

AT THE TIME OF THE ESD, ALL 4 UNITS AT THE STATION WERE RUNNING. WHEN THE STATION OPERATOR ARRIVED AT THE STATION IN RESPONSE TO A CALLOUT, HE NOTED PRESENCE OF FIRE IN THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING,  LINE 1804 BLOWDOWN STACK WAS FOUND TO BE RELEASING NATURAL GAS (MATERIAL) INTO ATMOSPHERE AND LINE 1804 SUCTION HEADER EMERGENCY VALVE (L-7210) NOT FULLY CLOSED ALLOWING MATERIAL TO CONTINUE TO FLOW TO THE STATION AND OUT THE BLOWDOWN STACK.  MATERIAL FLOWING INTO THE STATION THROUGH LINE 1804 WAS SHUT-OFF USING UPSTREAM BLOCK VALVES WHICH WERE MANUALLY CLOSED.  THE SOURCE OF THE FIRE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A COOLANT LEAK ON A SHORT FLEXIBLE HOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COOLANT HEADER AND HEAD CONNECTION AT CYLINDER NO. 5 ON AN ENGINE/COMPRESSOR PACKAGE.  THE OTHER UNITS WERE INSPECTED FOR SIMILAR INDICATIONS ON THE ETHANOL HOSES BEFORE THE OTHER UNITS WERE RETURNED BACK INTO SERVICE.

VINCENT COMPRESSOR STATION IN KITTSON COUNTY, MINNESOTA.  THE INCIDENT, WHICH RESULTED IN A SHUTDOWN OF THE PIPELINE VALVE SECTION BETWEEN THE COMPRESSOR STATION AND MLV 1-1-2, WAS THE RESULT OF A CONNECTION FAILURE OF A TWO-INCH DIAMETER PIG SIGNAL COMPONENT AT THE ABOVEMENTIONED LOCATION.  GAS WAS RELEASED AND SUBSEQUENTLY IGNITED.   FOLLOWING CONTROL OF THE RELEASE AND CONTROLLED BLOWDOWN OF THE PIPELINE SECTION, THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK CONFIRMED AS A FAILED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BASE OF A PIG SIGNAL OFFTAKE TUBE AND A BOLTED MOUNTING PLATE ATTACHED TO THE GLGT 200 LINE.      THE DAMAGED PIG SIGNAL COMPONENTS, INCLUDING THE PIG SIGNAL OFFTAKE TUBE WITH ASSOCIATED BASE (WHICH WAS ALREADY DISCONNECTED FROM THE PIPELINE) AND THE  LOWER MOUNTING PLATE, WERE REMOVED FROM THE PIPELINE AND SENT TO A THIRD-PARTY LABORATORY FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS.   THE PIG SIGNAL WAS NOT REPLACED.  THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED BY REMOVAL OF THE WELD-O-LET THAT CONNECTED THE BASE MOUNTING PLATE TO THE PIPELINE AND THEN INSTALLING A CONTOURED INSERT FITTING (VESSELET) AND CAP.  FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE REPAIR, THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE THE AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 22, 2015.    FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE PIG SIGNAL COMPONENTS INDICATED THAT THREE (3) OF THE FOUR (4) FASTENERS, SOCKET HEAD CAP SCREWS (SHCS), OF THE BOLTED MOUNTING PLATE CONNECTION FAILED BY A TIME-DEPENDENT, STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC) MECHANISM. THE WEST SHCS FAILURE MAY HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS DUE TO ITS VERY HIGH HARDNESS AND POSSIBLE UN-TEMPERED MARTENSITIC CONDITION. THE SOUTH SHCS FAILED LAST AND EXHIBITED WITH MIXED SCC AND DUCTILE RUPTURE MODES. ITS REMAINING LIGAMENT FAILED SUDDENLY WHEN ITS LOAD BEARING CAPACITY WAS EXCEEDED."

BECAUSE NO ADDITIONAL LEAK INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED DURING THIS PERIOD,  CONSUMERS ENERGY OPTED TO  CALCULATE THE HOURS FROM THE DATE THE LINE WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE ON OCTOBER 7TH UNTIL THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED AND THE LATERAL SHUT-DOWN RESULTING IN A GAS LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 37MMCF.  THE GAS LOSS CALCULATION BASED ON NOTIFICATION AND ISOLATION AND SHUT DOWN WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A GAS LOSS CALCULATION OF LESS THAN 1MMCF.    THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE CONSUMERS ENERGY TRAIL STREET LABORATORY FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.  LABORATORY ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE LEAK WAS A RESULT OF A LOCALIZED CORROSION PIT ON THE PIPE ID.

NOTING THAT COLUMBIA HAS A PIPELINE FACILITY NEARBY, COLUMBIA PERSONNEL STOPPED AND STARTED INVESTIGATING.  GAS SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THE IDENTIFIED BUBBLES LOCATION AND FROM THE CLOSEST MEASURING STATION.  THE TWO SAMPLES WERE SENT TO THE LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE DISCOVERED RELEASE WAS FROM A COLUMBIA PIPELINE OR OTHER OPERATORS IN THE AREA.  MEANWHILE, COLUMBIA OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE CLOSEST CRITICAL VALVES TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE FROM THE VALVES' OPERATING VALUE OF 800 PSIG DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 200 PSIG.  AFTER THE RESULTS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE LABORATORY, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE VISIBLE BUBBLES WERE EMANATING FROM A COLUMBIA PIPELINE.  ACCORDINGLY, A CONTRACTOR WAS ASSIGNED TO EXCAVATE AND COMPLETE THE NECESSARY REPAIR WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE FROM A PINHOLE LEAK IN A GIRTH WELD.  A LEAK CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND THE PIPELINE OPERATING PRESSURE WAS RAISED TO ITS NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2016.  KEY LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS INCIDENT WERE THAT  MAINTENANCE PIGGING ARE RECOMMENDED TO BE PERFORMED ON MORE ROUTINE SCHEDULED BASIS TO REMOVE TRAPPED LIQUIDS DUE TO LOW FLOW IN PIPELINE.

PERSON ON CALL CALLED A SECOND EMPLOYEE TO ASSIST WITH INVESTIGATION, DROVE TO STATION TO PICK UP A GAS DETECTOR AND SECOND EMPLOYEE, AND DROVE OVER TO THE SITE IN QUESTION. AFTER ARRIVING THE TWO EMPLOYEES BEGAN SCANNING THE RIGHT OF WAY AND DISCOVERED BUBBLES WITHIN THE RIGHT OF WAY LIMITS. AT THIS TIME THE LEAD RIGHT OF WAY EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON SITE AND BEGAN THE PROCESS OF ELIMINATING POTENTIAL FOREIGN LINE CROSSINGS BEING THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  RIGHT OF WAY LEAD CALLED DISTRICT MANAGER AND REPORTED HIS FINDINGS OF NO KNOWN FOREIGN LINE CROSSINGS AND HE WAS PICKING UP A SMALL GAS LEAK LOCATED ABOVE THE MAIN LINE C PIPE. DISTRICT MANAGER BEGAN MAKING CALLS TO PIPELINE CONTROL, CYPRESS DIVISION DIRECTOR, AND THE CYPRESS DIVISION MANAGER ENGINEERING WHO ASSISTED BY PIPELINE SAFETY. PIPELINE CONTROL CALLED AND REPORTED THE POSSIBLE LEAK TO THE NRC AND THE LOUISIANA STATE POLICE.             DISTRICT MANAGER INSTRUCTED RIGHT OF WAY LEAD TO ISOLATE THE C LINE PIPING SECTION BETWEEN THE 50C50 AND 50C60 AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND TO CONTINUE TO VERIFY IF THE LEAK WAS IN FACT COMING FROM OUR LINE.  AFTER ISOLATION THE STATION CREW MEMBERS INSTALLED GAUGES AT THE 50C50 AND 50C60 AND BEGAN TO MONITOR FOR ANY LOSS IN PRESSURE ON THE C LINE SECTION. OTHER CREW MEMBERS CONTINUED TO INVESTIGATE RECORDS FOR ANY FOREIGN LINE CROSSINGS AND CONTINUED UPDATING PIPELINE CONTROL AND CYPRESS DIVISION.              AFTER MONITORING PRESSURES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SHOWED NO DROP IN PRESSURE THE DISTRICT MANAGER DISCUSSED WITH THE DIVISION DIRECTOR THE NEED TO BLOW DOWN THE C LINE SECTION TO VERIFY THAT THE LEAK WAS EMANATING FROM THIS SECTION OF LINE. DIRECTOR AGREED, SAFE BLOW DOWN PROCEDURES WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE STATION CREW, AND THE 50C50 TO 50C60 LINE SECTION WAS BLOWN DOWN.            DISTRICT MANAGER AND DIVISION SAFETY EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT LEAK SITE WITH APPROX. 100 PSI REMAINING ON THE LINE SECTION. AT THIS TIME THE BUBBLES WERE VERIFIED TO HAVE STOPPED. STATION EMPLOYEES CONTINUED BLOW DOWN TO 0 PSI, SECURED ALL VALVES AND SITES, AND BEGAN SCHEDULING FOR INVESTIGATORY DIGS TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.           ***UPDATE PER SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 5/16/2016***        METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE LEAKING SECTION OF PIPE WAS MANUFACTURED WITH AN AREA OF VARYING HARDNESS. RCA INDICATES THAT THIS AREA OF PARTICULARLY HARDER STEEL WAS THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE CRACK FORMATION. THE INSPECTION OF AFFECTED PIPE SAMPLE WAS COMPLETED BY ANDERSON AND ASSOCIATES IN HOUSTON ON 4/15/16.  INSPECTIONS INDICATED ONLY THIS LOCALIZED AREA BECAME SUSCEPTIBLE TO EITHER HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT OR HIGH PH SCC MECHANISMS; WITHOUT THE HARD SPOT, THE LAB SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE CRACKING WOULD HAVE OCCURRED. UPON REVIEW OF THE 2013 ILI, TWO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION DIGS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN 2016 TO SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL AREAS OF ELEVATED HARDNESS. ONCE THESE TWO DIGS ARE EITHER REPAIRED OR CLEARED WITH REGARD TO HARD SPOTS, MAIN LINE 'C' FROM 50C41 TO 50C60 CAN BE CONSIDERED AT VERY LOW RISK FOR CRACKING SUSCEPTIBILITY DUE TO HARD SPOTS.     ***UPDATE PER SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 12/1/2016***    THE TWO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION DIGS REFERENCED ABOVE CAME BACK NEGATIVE FOR INDICATIONS OF THE SAME DEFECT THAT APPARENTLY CAUSED THIS INCIDENT.

THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT LEAKED WAS ANALYZED INTERNALLY DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL SIMILARITIES FROM A RECENTLY REPORTED FAILURE, WHICH WAS SENT TO A 3RD PARTY LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE INTERNAL ANALYSIS, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THIS FAILURE ARE IDENTICAL. THE PREVIOUS FAILURE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD OF THE PIPE WALL AT THE WELD TOE. THE PRIMARY FACTOR TO THE FAILURE WAS SETTLEMENT OF THE BRANCH CONNECTION DUE TO IMPROPER SUPPORT. THE SETTLEMENT CAUSED BENDING STRESSES IN THE CARRIER PIPE AT THE SADDLE REINFORCEMENT FILLET WELD WHICH RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF A CRACK. THE GEOMETRY OF THE FILLET WELD THAT ATTACHED THE SADDLE REINFORCEMENT PAD TO THE CARRIER PIPE WAS ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE. THE SADDLE THICKNESS WAS 2.5 TIMES THE THICKNESS OF THE CARRIER PIPE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A STRESS CONCENTRATION IN THE THINNER PIPE AT THE FILLET WELD TOE. UNDERCUT AT THE TOE OF THE FILLET WELD FURTHER CONCENTRATED THE STRESS AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FORMATION OF A CRACK."

THE 8 INCH HOT TAP VALVE AND HOT TAP MACHINE, CONTAINING THE CUTTER, WAS ATTACHED TO THE HOT TAP FITTING. THE CUTTING OF THE 16 INCH  PIPELINE WAS COMPLETED, THE HOT TAP VALVE WAS CLOSED, AND THE RESIDUAL PRESSURE WAS BLED DOWN ON THE HOT TAP MACHINE. THE CUTTER HEAD AND CUT COUPON WERE REMOVED FROM THE HOT TAP MACHINE AND THE PIG GUIDE BARS FITTING WAS ATTACHED TO THE MACHINE. THE HOT TAP MACHINE CONTAINING THE PIG GUIDE BAR FITTING WAS ATTACHED TO THE HOT TAP VALVE AND THE VALVE WAS OPENED TO BEGIN INSERTION OF THE PIG GUIDE BAR FITTING.

AN ANR TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE REPORTED LOCATION TO INVESTIGATE.  THE ANR TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION AT 14:20 ET.  FOLLOWING THE ARRIVAL AND INVESTIGATION OF THE SITE, THE TECHNICIAN CONCLUDED THAT DEAD VEGETATION AND ELEVATED LEVELS OF METHANE, AS MEASURED BY A GAS DETECTOR, IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPELINE WAS LIKELY DUE TO A GAS RELEASE.  THE SUSPECTED  GAS RELEASE PROMPTED A CALL TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AND AN INCIDENT REPORT (NRC #1152118) WAS FILED AT 15:23 ET ON 30 JUNE 2016. THE SECTION OF PIPE WAS ISOLATED AND THE PRESSURE REDUCED TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.    FOLLOWING EXCAVATION OF THE LOCATION, A GIRTHWELD FEATURE WAS DISCOVERED AND PRESUMED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE GAS RELEASE.  A 14 FOOT SECTION INCLUDING THE GIRTH WELD WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED WITH NEW PIPE. THE PIPE SECTION CONTAINING THE GIRTH WELD WAS SUBMITTED TO A LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS.    THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON 31 AUGUST 2016 AT 13:30 LOCAL TIME.    LABORATORY ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT LEAKING FLAW WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF AN INCOMPLETE FUSION ALONG THE ROOT PASS COUPLED WITH POROSITY IN FILL AND CAP FILL PASSES DURING INITIAL FABRICATION. THE INCOMPLETE FUSION AND POROSITY, IN COMBINATION, RESULTED IN AN AREA WHERE THE LOCAL TENSILE CAPACITY WAS LIMITED. DUE TO THE LIMITED BONDING BETWEEN THE WELD SURFACES, MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN THE TEMPERATURE DURING OPERATIONS CREATED TENSILE STRESSES THAT CONTRIBUTED EXTENSION OF THE WELD IMPERFECTION."

AFTER CONFIRMING THE SHUTDOWN REMOTELY, THE TECHNICIAN DROVE TO THE SITE AND FOUND THAT THE COMPRESSOR UNITS WERE NOT RUNNING, THE STATION SUCTION VALVE WAS OPEN AND THE SUCTION-VENT-VALVE WAS OPEN AND VENTING GAS.  THE STATION DISCHARGE AND VENT VALVES WERE CLOSED. THE TECHNICIAN CLOSED THE STATION SUCTION VALVES, STOPPING THE VENTING OF GAS, AND PROCEEDED TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE COMPRESSOR STATION.  AFTER REVIEWING THE STATUS, THE COMPRESSORS WERE RESTARTED AND THE TECHNICIAN REMAINED AT THE STATION FOR A COUPLE MORE HOURS TO MONITOR THE STATION.  THE QUANTITY OF GAS LOSS WAS NOT DETERMINED BY THE TECHNICIAN DURING THE AUGUST 3, 2016 EVENT.  ON AUGUST 4, 2016 AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CAUSE OF THE STATION SHUTDOWN FOUND THAT THERE WERE TWO EQUIPMENT ISSUES.  THE STATION'S SUCTION-VENT-VALVE HAD A SHORTED CLOSE-SOLENOID AND THE MOMENTARY-CLOSE PUSH-BUTTON THAT OPENS THE STATION SUCTION VALVE WAS STUCK CLOSED.  BOTH OF THESE COMPONENTS WERE REPAIRED AND THE COMPRESSOR UNITS AT THE STATION RETURNED TO SERVICE.  ON AUGUST 10, 2016, DURING THE EVALUATION OF GAS LOSS EVENTS IN THE AREA, EPNG PHOENIX AREA OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT BECAME AWARE THAT THE QUANTITY OF GAS RELEASED FOR THIS EVENT MET THE REPORTING CRITERIA FOR AN INCIDENT, UNINTENTIONAL GAS LOSS GREATER THAN 3000MCF, UNDER 49 CFR 191.5 AT WHICH TIME THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE NRC REPORT WAS SUBMITTED, EPNG ALSO NOTIFIED THE PHMSA WESTERN REGION AND THE ARIZONA CORPORATION COMMISSION PIPELINE SAFETY DIVISION.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE UNINTENTIONAL GAS RELEASE WAS AT LEAST TWO LOW-RESISTANCE TO GROUND FAULTS ON THE STATIONS 135 VDC CONTROL SYSTEM. BASED ON THIS FINDING, THE FIELD WIRING FOR BOTH THE STATION'S HIGH DISCHARGE PRESSURE SWITCH CIRCUIT AND THE STATION'S DISCHARGE LOADING VALVE CIRCUIT WILL BE REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE STATION'S DC SYSTEM WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ADDITIONAL LOW-RESISTANCE GROUND AND/OR DETERIORATION.

FOLLOWING THE GC PROTOCOLS, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED TO INVESTIGATE THIS ALARM AT THE CS.  SMITHFIELD CS (LOCATED IN WETZEL COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA) IS A TRANSMISSION CS THAT IS OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY COLUMBIA.    UPON ARRIVING AT THE CS, COLUMBIA PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THE SOURCE OF THE NOISE FROM THE RELEASED NATURAL GAS (MATERIAL) INTO ATMOSPHERE AND MANUALLY CLOSED THE PROPER VALVES ON SITE TO CONTROL THE MATERIAL RELEASE.  DUE TO THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF MATERIAL THAT EXCEEDED 3,000 MCF, IT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AS AN INCIDENT.  THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBABLE CAUSE BEHIND THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) ACTIVATION AT SMITHFIELD CS HAS BEEN TRACED TO A PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLER (PLC) ERROR THAT RESULTED IN A FAULTY SIGNAL TO THE PNEUMATIC SYSTEM, CAUSING THE ESD VENT VALVES TO OPEN.  THE ESD SYSTEM WAS INSPECTED WITH ITS RESPECTIVE COMPONENTS AND THE CS WAS RETURNED BACK INTO SERVICE ON AUGUST 25, 2016 AT 09:20 AM.   SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PLC PROGRAM AND ESD SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND MODIFIED TO PREVENT RE-OCCURRENCE.    THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS INVESTIGATION NOTED CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE LED TO THE UNINTENDED ESD OF THE SMITHFIELD CS.  THEY WERE: (I) ALARMS AND SYSTEM FAULTS WERE TO BE INVESTIGATED PRIOR TO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CLEARING.  NOTIFICATION PROCESS AND PROCEDURES MUST BE FOLLOWED. (II) ESD PILOT AIR SYSTEM TO BE TESTED AND INSPECTED TO ENSURE THAT IT FUNCTION AS REQUIRED. (III) AFTER AN ESD SYSTEM MALFUNCTION, THE  ESD SYSTEM DESIGN MAY NEED TO BE RE-EVALUATED TO ENSURE THAT IT PERFORMS AS REQUIRED AND EXPECTED.  (IV) ALARMS THAT DISABLE ESSENTIAL STATION COMPONENTS NEED TO BE FULLY VETTED AND INVESTIGATED TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE AND TO REMEDY THE ISSUE.  THE LISTED FOUR ITEMS IN THE RCA REPORT WERE IMPLEMENTED AND COMPLETED WHERE THE FACILITY DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY SIMILAR INDICATIONS THAT MAY POTENTIALLY INITIATE AN ESD SYSTEM FAILURE, SUBJECT TO THE CORRECTED KEY ITEMS IN THE RCA REPORT."

MARY PARRISH, IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA. THE LOCATION OF THESE BUBBLES WERE EMANATING IN THE PROXIMITY OF COLUMBIA'S LINE EL-100 AS WELL AS OTHER PIPELINE OPERATORS IN THE REGION. DUE TO THE VARIOUS CROSSING OF PIPELINES ALONG THE RIVER, THE INITIAL ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THE SOURCE OF THESES BUBBLES OF UNINTENDED RELEASE WAS FROM ANOTHER PIPELINE OPERATOR OTHER THAN COLUMBIA. COLUMBIA OPERATES AND MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF PIPELINES IN THE AREA. HOWEVER, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THESE RIVER CROSSINGS WERE ABANDONED BACK IN THE EARLY 80'S AND WERE KEPT IN IDLE STATUS WITH ABOUT 32 PSIG BLANKET PRESSURE. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER OPERATORS WHO DO HAVE PIPELINES CROSSING THE RIVER, IT WAS RULED OUT THAT THEIR PIPELINES WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS RELEASE. HENCE, COLUMBIA IDENTIFIED THAT THESE BUBBLES WERE EMANATING FROM COLUMBIA'S LINE EL-100. THEREAFTER, THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS NOTIFIED. THE REPORT TO THE NRC WAS MADE DUE TO THE EXPECTED COST TO ABANDON AND REMOVE LINE EL-100 SECTIONS OF PIPELINE CROSSING THE WAX LAKE OUTLET WOULD EXCEED $50,000. THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF MATERIAL DID NOT EXCEED 3,000 MCF. PLANS WERE SET FORTH TO ABANDON AND REMOVE THIS SECTION OF PIPELINE IN A TIMELY MANNER.  AFTER REMOVING THE FAILED SECTION OF LINE EL-100 FROM THE RIVER, AN ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO THE FAILED SECTION OF LINE EL-100 BY A METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS CONSULTANT.  THE ASSESSMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE FAILED SECTION WAS LIKELY SUBJECT TO LONGITUDINAL AND BENDING STRESSES IN CONJUNCTION WITH WALL LOSS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION / ADDITIONAL ROOT CAUSES:  THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND ASSOCIATED ANALYSIS PROVIDED THE CONCLUSION THAT INTERNAL CORROSION CAUSED THE PIPING RUPTURE. THINNING OF THE PIPE WALL WAS CAUSED BY SALT WATER CORROSION, ULTIMATELY LOWERING RUPTURE RESISTANCE.    ON NOVEMBER 19, 2015, EMPLOYEES AT STATION 535 DISCOVERED GAS LEAKING UP THROUGH THE GROUND IN THE STATION YARD AND UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE SOURCE TO BE THE 20 INCH UNDERGROUND LINE ON THE INLET SIDE OF STATION'S DEHYDRATION.  THIS LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN AND TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AS PLANS WERE PUT INTO PLACE FOR REPAIRS.  IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CONFIRMED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY INTERNAL CORROSION.  THE REPAIR CONSISTED OF REMOVING CORRODED PIPING UNTIL PIPING OF SUFFICIENT INTEGRITY WAS FOUND TO TIE NEW PIPING BACK INTO.  THIS REPAIR WORK WAS ALSO USED AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE DEAD HEADS AND OTHER PIPING IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY THAT WERE NO LONGER USED OR NOT NEEDED FOR THE PROCESS.  THE STATION WAS OUT OF SERVICE FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 WEEKS IN AN EFFORT TO IDENTIFY AND REPAIR AREAS OF CONCERN.  IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT ADDITIONAL DEAD HEADS EXISTED IN THE STATION AND A PROJECT WAS PLANNED FOR 2016 TO INVESTIGATE OTHER POTENTIAL DEAD HEADS FOR INTERNAL CORROSION.  THE 2016 PROJECT WAS DELAYED TO COINCIDE WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLANNED MECHANICAL INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT OF THE STATION VESSELS AND BELOW GROUND PIPING IN 2017.      THE UNDERGROUND PIPING IN THE YARD AND ABOVE GROUND HEADERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED. A FEW PIPES CONNECTING TO NATIONAL FUEL GAS WERE INSPECTED AND LEFT IN PLACE. THE DEHYDRATORS HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND REPLACED. FILTER SEPARATORS HAVE BEEN INSPECTED. GAS WAS INJECTED INTO THE SYSTEM ON 02/27/2019."

THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT EXTREME COLD TEMPERATURES CAUSED THE PNEUMATIC CONTROL SYSTEM TO FAIL ON THREE WAMSUTTER STATION VENT VALVES.  THE POWER GAS MIGRATED PAST THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS AND PRESSURED UP THE BACK SIDE OF THE CONTROL BLOCK, WHICH CAUSED THE VALVES TO OPEN.

HAMPSHIRE GAS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AT 4:10 AM AND OBSERVED A FIRE AT THE DEHYDRATOR FACILITIES AT THE SITE. THE REBOILER UNIT HAD CAUGHT FIRE. THE RESPONDING PERSONNEL MADE THE AREA SAFE BY VALVING OFF THE GAS TO THE INVOLVED FACILITY. THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT A PRESSURE REGULATING DEVICE FAILED TO REDUCE THE INCOMING PRESSURE TO THE LOWER SET POINT. THE PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATOR ALSO FAILED TO ACTIVATE TO RELIEVE THE OVERPRESSURE CONDITION. THESE FAILURES ALLOWED 600 PSI NATURAL GAS PRESSURE TO REACH THE LOW PRESSURE REGULATORS UTILIZED FOR INSTRUMENT GAS AND BURNER FUEL GAS IN THE DEHYDRATOR EQUIPMENT. THESE FIVE LOW PRESSURE DEVICES EXPERIENCED BRITTLE METAL FAILURE FROM THE HIGH PRESSURE GAS AND LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURES. THE FRACTURED METAL AND STEEL SET SCREWS FROM THE LOW PRESSURE REGULATORS STRUCK THE CONCRETE PAD AND STEEL SKID SUPPORT STRUCTURE CREATING SPARKS THAT MAY HAVE PROVIDED A POSSIBLE IGNITION SOURCE FOR THE ESCAPING NATURAL GAS. THE NOTICE OF THE INCIDENT CAME FROM AN ALERTS FROM SCADA. INSTRUMENT FAULT ALERTS AND ABNORMAL VALUES AROUND THE REBOILER WERE NOTICED. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE EQUIPMENT FAILURE FOUND THAT HIGHER MOISTURE CONTENT GAS CAUSED HYDRATES TO FORM AND FREEZE INSIDE THE REGULATOR AND RELIEF VALVE BODY. THE HYDRATES FREEZING CAUSED THE FAILURE OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT WAS LOCATED ON THE FUEL TRAIN FOR THE REBOILER."

THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED BY AN AERIAL PATROL DISPATCHED BY PIPELINE OPERATORS, AND WAS PROMPTLY REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION, THE PHMSA ANCHORAGE OFFICE, AND OTHERS.  PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED, AND INSPECTION AND REPAIR PLANNING INITIATED.  THE CAUSE OF THE NATURAL GAS LEAK WAS A PIPE BODY FAILURE DUE TO MECHANICAL ABRASION.  THE MECHANICAL ABRASION RESULTED FROM THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE PIPELINE AND A SUBMERGED ROCK RESTING ON THE SEAFLOOR.   INSPECTION AND REPAIR OF THE LEAK WERE COMPLICATED BY WINTER CONDITIONS IN COOK INLET.  LARGE FLOATING ICE PANS, BROKEN UP ICE AND LIMITED DAYLIGHT PREVENTED THE IMMEDIATE DISPATCH OF DIVERS TO INSPECT AND CONTAIN THE LEAK.   IN RESPONSE TO THE GAS LEAK, HILCORP IMPLEMENTED A MULTI-COMPONENT ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING AND MONITORING WORK PLAN TO QUANTIFY ANY POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GAS LEAK.  HILCORP SUBMITTED WEEKLY SAMPLING AND MONITORING DATA SUMMARY REPORTS TO ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION (ADEC) FOR TEN CONSECUTIVE WEEKS.  THE RESULTS FROM THE SAMPLING AND MONITORING PROGRAM DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WOULD SUGGEST HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT OR WILDLIFE AS A RESULT OF THE LEAK.  HILCORP DETERMINED THAT SHUTTING IN THE PIPELINE WOULD CAUSE SEAWATER TO ENTER THE DEPRESSURIZED PIPELINE THROUGH THE LEAK, LIKELY DISPLACING AND MOBILIZING RESIDUAL OIL REMAINING IN PIPELINE FROM A PRIOR OPERATOR'S 2005 CONVERSION OF SERVICE FROM CRUDE OIL TO NATURAL GAS.  THE GAS PIPELINE SUPPLIES HEAT, LIGHT AND POWER TO MGS PLATFORMS, LOSS OF WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE NAVIGATIONAL AID LIGHTING AND CATHODIC PROTECTION FOR THE FUEL LINE, PLATFORMS, AND ASSOCIATED PIPELINES.  A LACK OF FUEL GAS COULD PUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PLATFORM OPERATORS AT RISK AND LEAD TO DAMAGE TO THE PLATFORMS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE, AND COULD HAVE CAUSED PRODUCTION LINES TO FREEZE, CREATING A POTENTIAL SOURCE FOR AN OIL SPILL WHEN THE LINES THAWED.  ON MARCH 25, 2017, HILCORP REDUCED PIPELINE PRESSURE FROM 145 PSI TO 65 PSI; THE PRESSURE CALCULATED TO BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE OF WATER AT THE PIPE WALL. MAINTAINING POSITIVE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE WAS NECESSARY TO AVOID THE LIKELY RELEASE OF RESIDUAL HYDROCARBONS INSIDE THE PIPELINE. HILCORP CONTRACTED A DIVE TEAM WHO STOPPED THE LEAK BY INSTALLING A TEMPORARY CLAMP ON APRIL 13, 2017.  BY LETTER DATED MARCH 3, 2017, PHMSA ISSUED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED SAFETY ORDER TO HILCORP RELATED TO THE MGS FUEL GAS LINE.  PHMSA AND HILCORP ENTERED INTO A CONSENT AGREEMENT AND ORDER, EFFECTIVE APRIL 12, 2017.  PHMSA APPROVED A LEAK INSPECTION AND PERMANENT REPAIR PLAN ON MAY 9 AND DIVERS INSTALLED A PERMANENT REPAIR CLAMP IN PLACE OF THE TEMPORARY CLAMP. DIVERS SUCCESSFULLY TESTED THE PERMANENT CLAMP SEAL ON MAY 20, COMPLETING THE REPAIR PROCESS.   THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED BY DIVERS TO BE EXTERNAL FORCE DAMAGE; ABRASION OF THE PIPELINE BODY FROM CONTACT WITH A SUBMERGED ROCK RESTING ON THE SEAFLOOR.  TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF FUTURE ABRASION OF THE PIPELINE, DIVERS STABILIZED THE PIPE AT THE LEAK LOCATION TO PREVENT PIPE MOVEMENT.  HILCORP PERFORMED A SONAR INSPECTION OF THE SUBMERGED PIPELINE ROW ON JUNE 21.  AN ILI ASSESSMENT OF THE 8-INCH ""A"" PIPELINE, FROM MGS PLATFORM A TO SHORE, WAS COMPLETED JULY 19.  HILCORP SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED A PRESSURE TEST OF THE LINE ON SEPTEMBER 9, AND NORMAL FUEL GAS OPERATIONS RESUMED ON SEPTEMBER 16.  HILCORP WILL CONTINUE VARIOUS INSPECTIONS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APRIL 12, 2017 CONSENT AGREEMENT AND ORDER.   HILCORP INTEGRATED SONAR AND ILI DATA TO PRIORITIZE DIVER INSPECTIONS AND MITIGATION MEASURES.  DIVERS COMPLETED INSPECTIONS THEN ARMORED AND STABILIZED THE PIPELINE AT LOCATIONS IDENTIFIED BY DATA INTEGRATION."

THIS ADDITIONAL WORK DROVE THE COST OVER THE $50,000 REPORTING LIMIT. THIS LEAK WAS CONSIDERED A GRADE 3 LEAK (IN ACCORDANCE WITH GPTC GUIDE MATERIAL FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF LEAKS, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED NON-HAZARDOUS AND EXPECTED TO REMAIN SO AND COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO ON-GOING MONITORING) SO NO NRC REPORT WAS MADE AND THE REPAIR WAS NEVER HANDLED BY THE COMPANY AS ANYTHING BUT ROUTINE.

THIS SURVEY IS A PREVENTIVE AND MITIGATING MEASURE NORTHERN CONDUCTS WHICH IS BEYOND PIPELINE SAFETY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

WHEN COMPLETED, THE LEAKING SECTION OF PIPE WAS REMOVED AND INVESTIGATED FURTHER.     THE LEAK WAS FOUND TO BE LOCATED AT A CIRCUMFERENTIAL GIRTH WELD AT A CREEK CROSSING. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE LEAK ON KT-1.    - THIS PIPE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED IN A SEASONAL CREEK CROSSING AND WAS SUBJECT TO ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION WHEN THE WATER LEVEL RECEDED.     - LOW CATHODIC PROTECTION LEVELS WERE PREVIOUSLY FOUND DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF NEARBY DRESSER COUPLINGS. ALTHOUGH THESE LOW LEVELS OF CP WERE REMEDIATED, CORROSION HAS PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED.  - IN 2012, THE CREEK CROSSING WAS REMEDIATED BY ADDING GROUND COVER. THE PIPE APPEARS TO HAVE EXPERIENCED STRESS FROM ADDED WEIGHT ABOVE PIPE GRADE AND LACK OF SUPPORT BELOW PIPE GRADE. THE REMAINING WALL THICKNESS AT THE GIRTH WELD APPEARS TO HAVE MECHANICALLY FAILED DUE TO THIS STRESS.    A FINAL REPAIR COST CANNOT BE PROVIDED AT THIS TIME AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN IT CAN BE DETERMINED."

THE FACILITY IS APPROXIMATELY 1.4 MILES SOUTH OF AVINGER, TEXAS. LINE AM-199 HAS A MAOP OF 1000 PSIG AND IS A SOURCE FOR LINE AM-47, WHICH HAS A MAOP OF 500 PSIG    UPON ARRIVAL AT THE STATION ON THE 10/24/2017, THE O&M TECHNICIAN STOPPED THE VENTING AND INSPECTED THE STATION. HE DISCOVERED THE CONTROLLER WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SET POINT OF 500 PSIG. THE O&M TECHNICIAN MOVED THE CONTROLLER BACK TO THE REQUIRED SET POINT (470 PSIG) AND TIGHTENED THE CONTROLLER ARM, WHICH WAS LOOSE. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF ALL WORK, A TEST GAGE WAS INSTALLED AND THE PRESSURE WAS MONITORED. THE STATION OPERATED NORMALLY AT THE 470 PSIG SET POINT FOR 30 MINUTES.    THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED ON 10/24/2017 AT 11:45 (NRC# 1194155). A FOLLOW UP CALL WAS PROVIDED TO THE NRC ON 10/26/2017 AT 09:00 (NRC# 1194335).     WHILE THIS LOCATION DOES NOT HAVE MEASUREMENT FACILITIES, THERE IS A MEASUREMENT STATION 20 MILES UPSTREAM AND ANOTHER 12 MILES DOWNSTREAM. STARTING OCTOBER 17TH, SYSTEM CONTROL REPORTED AN INCREASE IN FLOW OF GAS IN THIS AREA BUT COULD NOT LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE IMBALANCE. SYSTEM CONTROL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE LOCAL OPERATIONS WHO SYSTEMATICALLY STARTED BACKTRACKING STATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING UNTIL THE VENTING RELIEF VALVE WAS DISCOVERED ON 10/24/17.     THE FINAL GAS LOSS CALCULATION WAS DETERMINED BY THE MEASUREMENT GROUP FOR THE AREA WHO DETERMINED THE RELIEF VALVE BLEW INTERMITTENTLY FOR 14 DAYS UNTIL DISCOVERY ON 10/24/2017.    DURING THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED ENABLE O&M TECHNICIANS WERE TESTING REGULATORS AT THIS INTERCONNECT ON 10/10/2017. AN OUTAGE PREVENTION FORM WAS UTILIZED AND TEST GAUGE WAS INSTALLED TO MONITOR PRESSURE AT THE STATION WHILE TESTING. AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARRIVAL, THE CONTROLLER NEEDLE INDICATED A SET POINT OF APPROXIMATELY 420 PSIG. ALTHOUGH THE TEST GAUGE READ A PRESSURE OF 470 PSIG, THE SET POINT ON THE CONTROLLER WAS WITHIN THE REQUIRED RANGE AND NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE. AFTER TESTING WAS COMPLETED AND WHILE LOADING TOOLS, THE O&M TECHNICIANS MONITORED THE PRESSURE AT THE REGULATOR STATION WITH A TEST GAGE. AFTER MONITORING PRESSURE FOR 20 MINUTES, A FINAL READING OF APPROXIMATELY 470 PSIG WAS READ AND THE TECHNICIANS LEFT THE REGULATOR STATION.     ALTHOUGH THE INVESTIGATION CITED EQUIPMENT FAILURE AS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE (MORE SPECIFICALLY THE LOOSE TENSION ON THE CONTROLLER ARM ALLOWING THE SET POINT TO MOVE), THE DECISION WAS MADE TO IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND, AND ULTIMATELY DISQUALIFY, THE TWO O&M TECHNICIANS ON THEIR OQ TASKS FOR TESTING REGULATORS AND CONTROL VALVES. THIS DECISION WAS BASED UPON THE FACT THEY WERE TESTING AT THE LOCATION THE DAY THE EVENT BEGAN ON 10/10/2017. THE OPERATORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE RE-OBSERVED ON THEIR TASKS.

GAS CONTROL RECEIVED AN INITIAL CALL FROM A LANDOWNER REPORTING THAT A RELEASE OF GAS WAS AUDIBLE ON 10/21/17 AT 3:15 AM. THIS WAS THE INITIAL OPERATOR IDENTIFICATION OF THE INCIDENT. GAS CONTROL RELAYED THE INFORMATION TO THE ON-DUTY OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR. THE ON-DUTY OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR CONTACTED THE LANDOWNER ON 10/21/17 AT 3:20 AM. AT THAT POINT IN TIME, THE LANDOWNER STATED THAT A RELEASE OF GAS WAS INITIALLY AUDIBLE, BUT THE SOUND HAD SINCE SUBSIDED. GAS CONTROL RECEIVED ANOTHER CALL FROM A DIFFERENT LANDOWNER REPORTING THAT A RELEASE OF GAS WAS AUDIBLE ON 10/21/17 AT 8:45 AM. GAS CONTROL RELAYED THE INFORMATION TO THE ON-DUTY OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR. THE ON-DUTY OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR DISPATCHED EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE. EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL ARRIVED IN THE GENERAL AREA AND INITIATED A SEARCH TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE SOURCE OF THE SOUND ON 10/21/17 AT 10:00 AM. ONCE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE SOURCE OF THE SOUND WAS DETERMINED, THE EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL VISUALLY CONFIRMED ON 10/21/17 AT 12:26 PM THAT GAS WAS BLOWING FROM TWO HOLES IN THE GROUND ON EITHER SIDE OF H-20778. H-20778 CONNECTS LOST CREEK STORAGE WELL CW224 TO TL-414. THIS LEAD TO THE INITIAL BELIEF THAT THERE WAS A MINOR LEAK ON H-20778. THE ESTIMATED PRESSURE ON H-20778 AT THE POINT AND TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS 995 PSIG. THE EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL ISOLATED THE IMPACTED SEGMENT OF H-20778 BY CLOSING THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM MANUAL VALVES ON 10/21/17 AT 1:15 PM. H-20778 WAS EXCAVATED AT THE LOCATION OF THE TWO HOLES IN THE GROUND AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT H-20778 HAD A CRACK IN IT ON 10/23/17 AT 1:00 PM. THIS DIFFERED FROM THE INITIAL BELIEF THAT THERE WAS A MINOR LEAK ON H-20778. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT H-20778 HAD RUPTURED AND THAT THE UNINTENTIONAL ESTIMATED GAS LOSS OF THREE MILLION CUBIC FEET OR MORE THRESHOLD MAY HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN EXCEEDED ON 10/23/17 AT 3:30 PM. INITIAL TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NRC ON 10/23/17 AT 4:07 PM AND NRC REPORT NUMBER 1194074 WAS ISSUED. AN UPDATE NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NRC ON 10/25/17 AT 8:25 AM, BUT A SUBSEQUENT NRC REPORT NUMBER WAS NOT ISSUED. THE SECTION OF PIPE CONTAINING THE RUPTURE ON H-20778 WAS CUT OUT FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. H-20778 WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO SERVICE AND DID NOT REPRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE SECTION OF PIPE CONTAINING THE RUPTURE ON H-20778 WAS PERFORMED BY KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES, INC. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE RUPTURE WAS LIKELY THE RESULT OF AXIAL TENSILE OVERLOAD OF THE PIPE WHICH CREATED A CIRCUMFERENTIAL FRACTURE WHICH INITIATED AT THE 12:00 POSITION AND ARRESTED AT THE 3:00 AND 9:00 POSITIONS WITH A MAXIMUM WIDTH OF 0.5 INCHES AND LENGTH OF 9.8 INCHES. THE FRACTURE WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 2.5 INCHES DOWNSTREAM FROM A GIRTH WELD. THE PIPE SURFACE AT AND ADJACENT TO THE GIRTH WELD, WHICH INCLUDED THE LOCATION OF THE FRACTURE, WAS COATED WITH A POLYETHYLENE TAPE / SHRINK SLEEVE WHICH HAD FAILED AT SOME POINT IN TIME AND RESULTED IN CATHODIC PROTECTION SHIELDING. THE PIPE EXHIBITED A BEND AT THE LOCATION OF THE FRACTURE WITH AN APPROXIMATE 3 DEGREE ANGLE OF DEFLECTION. THE PIPE WAS ORIGINALLY INSTALLED WITH NO ANGLE OF DEFLECTION.

THE TWO COMPANY PERSONNEL WERE PERFORMING ROUTINE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE TO THE MS. THE LINE WAS DEPRESSURIZED AND THE CLOSURE WAS OPENED IN ORDER TO PERFORM THE MAINTENANCE. AT THE COMPLETION OF THE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY, THE CLOSURE WAS CLOSED AND SECURED WITH A SWING BOLT. THE LINE WAS PRESSURIZED AND AN UNINTENDED RELEASE WAS IDENTIFIED AT THE HEAD OF THE CLOSURE. UPON COMPLETING THE MAINTENANCE TASKS AND RETURNING THE FACILITY BACK INTO SERVICE BEFORE LEAVING THE SITE, THE SOUND OF A POTENTIAL RELEASE WAS HEARD BY ONE OF THE MEASUREMENT AND REGULATION (M&R) TECHNICIANS. BASED ON REPORTED WITNESS STATEMENTS, WHILE INVESTIGATING THE NATURE OF THE UNINTENDED RELEASE, THE SINGLE BOLT MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF BEING TIGHTENED IN AN EFFORT TO STOP THE POTENTIAL LEAK AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE. THE CLOSURE FAILURE FATALLY INJURED THE M&R TECHNICIAN INVESTIGATING THIS UNINTENDED RELEASE.  THE FAILED SECTIONS WERE SENT TO A METALLURGICAL LABORATORY FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS INVESTIGATION, TO DETERMINE THE PROBABLE CAUSE BEHIND THE FAILURE OF THE SWING BOLT. THE LABORATORY REPORT IDENTIFIED THE INCIDENT WAS CAUSED DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE SWING BOLT PIN. THE VERTICAL ORIENTATION OF THE DUCTILE SHEAR OBSERVED ON THE FRACTURE SURFACE OF THE SWING BOLT PIN IS CONSISTENT WITH A LOADING DIRECTION IMPACTED WHILE TIGHTENING THE SWING BOLT NUT AND PLACING THE SWING BOLT PIN INTO DOUBLE SHEAR.

TWO PLATFORM PERSONNEL RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES FOR WHICH  THEY WERE TREATED AT A MEDICAL FACILITY AND RELEASED. ALL PLATFORM PERSONNEL WERE REMOVED FROM THE PLATFORM ON  NOVEMBER 8, 2017. THE FIRE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTINGUISHED ON NOVEMBER 9, 2017 BY LOWERING PRESSURE ON THE PIPELINE  AND PERSONNEL RETURNED TO THE PLATFORM. THE ENBRIDGE 30-INCH PIPELINE HAS NOT RETURNED TO SERVICE. THE CAUSE OF THE  INCIDENT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:  ENBRIDGE DID NOT OPERATE THE PLATFORM OR THE PIGGING OPERATIONS.  THOSE ACTIVITIES WERE CONDUCTED BY THE THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR PLATFORM OPERATOR USING THEIR PROCEDURES.  THE PLATFORM PERSONNEL WHO WERE INJURED WERE EMPLOYED BY THE THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR PLATFORM OPERATOR.  GIVEN THIS EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP, ENBRIDGE IS NOT AWARE OF WHETHER THE PLATFORM PERSONNEL RECEIVED DOT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING.  ADDITIONALLY, ENBRIDGE HAS LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE TWO INJURED PLATFORM PERSONNEL SUSTAINED INJURIES MORE SIGNIFICANT THAT ORIGINALLY REPORTED.  FINALLY, SIX MEMBERS OF A PAINTING CREW HOUSED IN THE CREW QUARTERS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT CLAIM EMOTIONAL AND/OR PHYSICAL INJURIES, BUT THOSE CLAIMS HAVE NOT BEEN VERIFIED.    THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE WAS A 1,086 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE BARREL (AT THE POINT OF THE FAILURE) WAS 400 PSIG.    THE RESULT OF THE METALLURGICAL INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS INCOMPLETE CLOSURE OF THE CLAMP RINGS ONTO THE DOOR AND BARREL FLANGES WHICH OCCURRED WHILE THE THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR PLATFORM OPERATOR WAS PERFORMING ROUTINE PIPELINE MAINTENANCE PIGGING OPERATIONS ON THE ENBRIDGE 30-INCH PIPELINE.

LINE 600 STRETCHES APPROXIMATELY 34 MILES FROM THE CLARKSTON JUNCTION INTERCHANGE IN CLARKSTON, MI (OAKLAND COUNTY) TO THE UTICA CITY GATE, UTICA, MI (MACOMB COUNTY).      CONSUMERS ENERGY EMPLOYEES ARRIVED ONSITE AT APPROXIMATELY 2243 HOURS AND BEGAN THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE 6.5 MILE SEGMENT OF LINE 600 UTILIZING EMERGENCY VALVES LOCATED AT ORION CITY GATE, ORION CHARTER TOWNSHIP, MI AND DIXIE-WATERFORD CITY GATE, CLARKSTON, MI.  THE SEGMENT WAS FULLY ISOLATED AND CLOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 2307 HOURS.    THE ESCAPING HIGH-PRESSURE NATURAL GAS IGNITED.  FIRE DAMAGE EXTENDED ALONG THE PIPELINE RIGHT-OF-WAY AND DAMAGED SEVERAL TRACTOR TRAILERS PARKED AT THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY AT 693 BROWN ROAD.  LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL RESPONDED. THERE WERE NO FATALITIES OR INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE RUPTURE.    THE DAMAGED PIPELINE AND ASSOCIATED FRAGMENTS WERE SECURED AND TRANSPORTED TO CONSUMERS ENERGY'S TRAIL STREET LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL TESTING AND DETERMINATION OF A FAILURE MODE. A PRELIMINARY CAUSE OF FAILURE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS OVERLOAD FAILURE DUE TO FILL MATERIAL PLACE OVER THE PIPELINE.    AN INTERNAL TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT TO COMPLETE A ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION.  THE INVESTIGATION INCLUDED DEVELOPING A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS, AND A REVIEW OF THE SCENE AND PERTINENT FACTS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY A ROOT CAUSE(S).  COUNTERMEASURES WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED TO PREVENT RE-OCCURRENCE.      THE RUPTURED SEGMENT OF LINE 600 WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO SERVICE UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION AND APPROPRIATE REMEDIATION ACTIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.     CONSUMERS ENERGY LABORATORY SERVICES CONCLUDED THE RUPTURE ON CONSUMERS ENERGY LINE 600 WAS THE RESULT OF A TENSILE OVERLOAD THROUGH THE 22"" OD X 0.281 WALL PIPE ADJACENT TO THE EAST END GIRTH WELD WHERE AN 11.8' SECTION OF 22"" OD X 0.375 WALL PIPE WAS INSTALLED DURING REMEDIATION WORK IN 2009.    THE INSTANTANEOUS NATURE OF OVERLOAD FAILURE AND THE TIME DURATION FROM WHEN THE PIPE WAS INSTALLED UNTIL THE FAILURE OCCURRED SUGGESTS LOADING CONDITIONS CHANGED OVER TIME; HOWEVER, THE EXACT CAUSE FOR THIS FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINE FROM METALLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS.  CORROSION WAS NOT FOUND TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE FAILURE.    THE RCA TEAM SIMILARLY DETERMINED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE FAILURE TO BE OVERLOAD AS A RESULT OF APPROXIMATELY 21' OF FILL MATERIAL ON TOP OF THE GAS PIPELINE WHICH LACKED SUPPORT DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HIGHLY COMPRESSIBLE SOILS BELOW THE PIPELINE.  THE WELD ID OFFSET (HI-LO) WHICH EXCEEDED CODE ALLOWABLE 0.155"" VERSUS 3/32"" (.09375) AT THE 2009 REMEDIATION TIE-IN TO EXISTING PIPE WAS DETERMINE TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR BUT NOT A SECONDARY ROOT CAUSE.    THE RCA TEAM ALSO IDENTIFIED HUMAN AND SYSTEMIC ROOT COMPONENTS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE.  CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR REOCCURRENCE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED.    CONSUMERS ENERGY REPLACED APPROXIMATELY 1,200 FEET OF LINE 600 NORTH OF BROWN RD. AND WEST OF JOSLYN RD. IN LAKE ORION, MI. THE ENTIRE DISTANCE WAS REPLACED USING HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING METHODS (HDD). THE HDD METHOD WAS SELECTED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE DEPTHS BELOW THE COMPRESSIBLE ORGANIC SOIL LAYERS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE PIPELINE.     ALL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AND HYDROSTATIC TESTING WERE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND THE RUPTURE SEGMENT OF THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATIONS ON FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2018."

THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY STATION 2777+18 ON THE ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 1.  UPON CONFIRMATION  THAT THE THIRD-PARTY STRIKE CAUSED A RUPTURE AND FIRE RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF TWO (2) PERSONS AND INJURIES TO TWO (2) OTHERS, WHO WERE IMMEDIATELY HOSPITALIZED, NGPL ISSUED A REVISED NRC NOTICE (NO. 1198866). ONE OF THE INJURED PERSONS WAS RELEASED ON DECEMBER 6, 2017, AND THE OTHER WAS LISTED AS BEING IN STABLE CONDITION ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT.        TWO AUTOMATIC VALVES (I-9 AND I-10) ON THE ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 1 BEGAN TO CLOSE UPON THE DETECTION OF A PRESSURE LOSS AND ISOLATE THE DAMAGED PORTION OF PIPELINE, AS DESIGNED.  VALVE I-9 REQUIRED ADDITIONAL MANUAL OPERATION TO FULLY CLOSE THE VALVE.  THIS WAS COMPLETED BY 10:44 AM LOCAL TIME, WITH THE FLOW OF GAS SHUT OFF, THE FIRE CONTAINED, AND LATER EXTINGUISHED.      AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, NGPL ALSO REDUCED THE PRESSURE OF THE ADJACENT ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 2 TO 485 PSIG PENDING AN INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF IT SUSTAINED ANY DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SITE, A PHMSA REPRESENTATIVE REQUESTED THAT NGPL FURTHER REDUCE THE OPERATING PRESSURE OF ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 2 TO 450 PSIG, WHICH NGPL DID. RESULTS OF THE ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 2 INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT NO DAMAGE WAS SUSTAINED AND NGPL BEGAN RE-PRESSURING ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 2 TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE, CONSISTENT WITH PHMSA REGULATORY REVIEWS AND APPROVALS.    ON WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2017, NGPL  BEGAN REPAIRS TO ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 1.  A FINAL 48-HOUR CONFIRMATION NRC REPORT NO. 1199018 WAS PROVIDED THAT SAME DAY WITH A FINAL ESTIMATED VOLUME OF THE RELEASE.      REPAIR WORK CONSISTED OF THE REPLACEMENT OF 41 FEET OF 20-INCH PIPE ON THE ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 1 WITH PRE-PRESSURE TESTED PIPE AND WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 9, 2017, AND AT 4:39 PM CENTRAL TIME, NGPL PLACED  ILLINOIS LATERAL NO. 1 BACK INTO FULL SERVICE.       NGPL INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT AND CONCLUDED THAT THE LINE STRIKE AND RUPTURE RESULTED FROM M&R FARMS FAILING TO SUBMIT A LOCATE REQUEST TO JULIE AS REQUIRED BY ILLINOIS LAW PRIOR TO COMMENCING ITS EXCAVATION WORK RELATED TO THE INSTALLATION OF DRAINAGE TILE.  BECAUSE M&R FARMS FAILED TO PROVIDE THE REQUISITE NOTIFICATION, NGPL WAS UNABLE TO RESPOND, AND SPECIFICALLY WAS UNABLE TO MARK THE LOCATION OF ITS PIPELINE FACILITIES AND FOLLOW PROCEDURES RELATED TO DAMAGE PREVENTION.

THERE WERE TWO COMPRESSOR OPERATOR WORKING (SCOTTY MAYFIELD AND TYLER DAHLEM), THAT WERE LOCATED  JUST EAST OF THE BLOW OUT. THEY WERE NOT INJURED BUT WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO FEEL THE PERCUSSION FROM THE  BLAST. THEY IMMEDIATELY RAN TO THE MAIN ENTRY GATE OF THE STATION WHERE ONE OF THE THREE ESD ACTIVATION  SITES ARE LOCATED AND ACTIVATED THE ESD FOR THE WHOLE STATION (6:33 A.M. ACCORDING TO THE HISTORY ON  SCADA) SINCE IT WAS STILL UNCLEAR WHAT ALL WAS ON FIRE. THIS ONLY TOOK A COUPLE OF MINUTES. AFTER THE ESD  WAS ACTIVATED THE BLOWING GAS AND FIRE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO DECREASE. THE OPERATORS DID NOT HAVE A  CELL PHONE WITH THEM, SO SCOTTY, THE SENIOR OPERATOR INSTRUCTED TYLER, THE TRAINEE COMPRESSOR OPERATOR  I, TO RUN OVER TO THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE  AND CALL 911. SCOTTY WENT AROUND THE SOUTH FENCE OUT OF THE ""HOT ZONE"" TO GET BACK TO THE OFFICE AND  THEN CALLED HIS SUPERVISOR, JUNIOR BOWEN AND JAMES DAHLEM. (JAMES DAHLEM AND TIM REYNOLDS WAS  ALREADY AT THE OZARK OPERATIONS CENTER AND WENT IMMEDIATELY TO DRAKE STATION TO HELP. JUNIOR BOWEN  WAS STILL AT HOME AND IMMEDIATELY HEADED THAT WAY WHILE CONTACTING 911, AMY YORK, KEITH MASINGALE,  BJ WILLSON, GARY ENGLISH AND BRENT SAMPLEY) SCOTTY THEN CALLED GAS CONTROL AND RELAYED WHAT WAS  HAPPENING AND ASKED THEM TO SHUT OFF THE WOOLSEY AND STOCKTON STORAGE. BY THIS TIME JAMES DAHLEM  AND TIM REYNOLDS ARRIVED AND PARKED AT THE ENTRANCE AND STARTED MONITORING THE AIR FOR GAS LEL TO MAKE  SURE IT WAS SAFE TO ENTER. THEY STARTED HELPING SCOTTY AND TYLER FIGURE OUT WHAT HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED,  HAD TO SHUT THE GAS OFF OF THE DUMP LINE AT UNIT #15 BECAUSE THE BLOWN OUT 12"" LINE HAD BROKEN THE  PLASTIC DUMP LINE AND IT WAS ON FIRE. BJ WILLSON, FIRE DEPARTMENT AND STATE POLICE ARRIVED RIGHT BEHIND  JAMES DAHLEM AND WE ASKED THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPT. TO KEEP NON-BLACK HILLS PEOPLE AWAY. WE ALSO  ASKED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO STAND-BY UNTIL WE HAD SECURED ALL BLOWING GAS. BRENT SAMPLEY ARRIVED AND  THEN JUNIOR BOWEN ARRIVED. I (JUNIOR BOWEN) STARTED ACCESSING WHERE THE DAMAGE WAS AND BECAME THE  ON-SEEN INCIDENT COMMANDER. I WAS COMMUTING VIA PHONE WITH GAS CONTROL AND THE ERL PHONE CALL TO  COORDINATE GETTING GAS BACK INTO SERVICE AND GETTING CONSTRUCTION CREWS ON THE WAY TO HELP REPAIR THE  BROKEN GAS LINE. AFTER WE WERE SURE ALL BLOWING GAS HAD BEEN SECURED I HAD THE COMPRESSOR OPERATORS  START RETURNING UNITS BACK TO SERVICE. ACCORDING TO THE HISTORICAL DATA ON THE SCADA THE COMPRESSORS  STARTED BACK IN SERVICE AT 8:14 AM. WE THEN ASKED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO COME INTO THE COMPRESSOR  STATION AND PUT OUT THE SMALL FIRE (NONE GAS) ON THE #14 COMP. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THEN WENT TO THE  NORTH SIDE OF THE STATION OUTSIDE OUR PROPERTY AND PUT OUT A SMALL BRUSH FIRE. WITH THE DAMAGED PIPE  ISOLATED THIS TOOK 5 COMPRESSORS OUT OF SERVICE. THE CONSTRUCTION CREWS REMOVED THE DAMAGED SECTION  OF PIPE AND PIPELINE INTEGRITY GROUP ASSESSED THE REMAINING PIPE WE ABLE TO PUT THREE COMPRESSORS BACK  INTO SERVICE. UNITS #13 AND #14 WERE NOT ABLE TO RETURN TO SERVICE BECAUSE OF EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.  PHMSA/APSC REPORTING (PRESTON WALKER)  O FIRST NOTIFICATION OF THIS INCIDENT TO MR.

THE RUPTURE OCCURRED ALONG THE GIRTH WELD SEAM OF WELD ID BML-079 (STA.209+05.9). THE RUPTURED GIRTH WELD WAS A MAIN LINE WELD BETWEEN TWO 24-INCH OUTER DIAMETER (OD),  0.344-INCH WALL THICKNESS (WT), API 5L PSL 2 X70 GRADE PIPE. THE RUPTURE OCCURRED BETWEEN ROAD 513 AND ROAD 379 IN A FORESTED PORTION OF THE RIGHT OF WAY (ROW). THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE (MAOP) OF THE LINE AT THIS LOCATION IS 1444 PSIG AND WAS OPERATING AT 1297 PSIG AT THE TIME OF RUPTURE. THE RUPTURE LOCATION IS APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES FROM THE MARK WEST PROCESSING PLANT AND 10 MILES FROM THE SENECA COMPRESSOR STATION. THE ENTIRE ROUTE IS CLASS 1 NON-HCA. THE LINE WAS NOT FLOWING ANY GAS AT THE TIME OF FAILURE. FIRE RESULTED FROM THE LINE FAILURE, THERE WERE NO INJURIES, AND THE ONLY KNOWN PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS TO SURROUNDING TREES.     TALLGRASS CONDUCTED A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA) WITH THE GOALS OF IDENTIFYING CAUSAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUPTURE EVENT AND DEVELOPING POTENTIAL PROACTIVE ACTION PLANS FOR ELIMINATING SIMILAR THREATS. THE RCA TEAM FOCUSED ON CAUSAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUPTURE EVENT: ENVIRONMENTAL, MATERIALS, CONSTRUCTION/INSTALLATION AND INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT.    SUBSEQUENT TO THE RCA DISCUSSION, AND WITH AGREEMENT FROM ALL PARTIES INVOLVED, IT WAS DEEMED THAT THE GIRTH WELD RUPTURE WAS AN OVERLOAD FAILURE CAUSED BY AXIAL STRESS DUE TO MOVEMENT OF THE PIPE THAT EXCEEDED THE CROSS-SECTIONAL TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE NET SECTION WELD ZONE SURROUNDING THE CRACK INITIATION LOCATION. THIS DETERMINATION IS SUPPORTED BY METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, STRAIN CAPACITY EVALUATION  AND GEOTECHNICAL FINDINGS."

AT 8:00PM AN ERL CALL WAS SENT OUT. AT 8:03 LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THAT THE STATION ESD VALVE WAS STILL VENTING GAS BEYOND THE TYPICAL STATION BLOW DOWN TIME.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION PERSONNEL FOUND THAT STATION DISCHARGE VALVE  (A2-D1) DID NOT FULLY CLOSED AS REQUIRED WITH AN ESD EVENT.  PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THAT THE SUPPLY GAS TUBING TO THE STATION DISCHARGE VALVE'S ACTUATOR CAME DISLODGED DURING THE INITIATION OF THE ESD PROCESS WHICH PREVENT THE FULL CLOSURE OF THIS VALVE.  PERSONNEL ISOLATED THE SUPPLY GAS AND THEN RECONNECTED IT TO THE ACTUATOR.  ONCE RECONNECTED THE GAS SUPPLY WAS OPENED AGAIN AND THE STATION DISCHARGE VALVE CLOSED AS REQUIRED.  THIS STOPPED THE VENTING OF NATURAL GAS FROM THE STATION'S ESD VALVE.

VINCENT COMPRESSOR STATION IN MINNESOTA. THE LEAK LOCATION WAS EXCAVATED ON 4/10/18 AND VISUALLY DETERMINED TO BE ORIGINATING FROM A BURIED 24 INCH ELL FITTING. AN UNDERGROUND 24"" ELL DEVELOPED A PIN HOLE LEAK. THE 24"" ELL CONNECTED TO A 1"" WELD-O-LET, THEN TO 1"" PIPING LEADING TO AN ABOVE GROUND PRESSURE TRANSMITTER, USED FOR FLOW MEASUREMENT PURPOSES. THE 24"" ELL WAS CUT OUT AN REPLACED. THE CUT OUT SECTION WAS SENT TO METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS COMPANY FOR IMMEDIATE CAUSE DETERMINATION.    THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY CONCLUDED THERE WERE TWO LEAK LOCATIONS PRESENT IN THE ELBOW SECTION; ONE IN THE ELBOW AND ONE IN THE ATTACHED PIPING.  THE LEAK IN THE PIPING WAS LOCATED AT A THROUGH-WALL CRACK AT THE TOE OF THE WELD BETWEEN THE PIPING AND WELD-O-LET.  THE CRACK WAS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY OVERLOAD, ALTHOUGH THIS CAUSE COULD NOT BE DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED BECAUSE OF EROSION DAMAGE TO THE FRACTURE SURFACES.  THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK IN THE ELBOW WAS EROSION FROM THE GAS ESCAPING FROM THE CRACK IN THE PIPING.    TRANSCANADA SME EVALUATION CONCLUDED, THE LIKELY SOURCE OF THE OVERLOAD REFERENCED IN THE METALLURGICAL REPORT WAS THE 1"" RISER BEING PULLED UPWARD BY THE SOIL AROUND IT NEAR THE GROUND SURFACE IN A PROCESS CALLED ""FROST JACKING"" DURING THE COLD MONTHS. THE REPEATED CYCLES OF FREEZING AND THAWING MAY HAVE INDUCED STRESSES ON THE ELBOW-PIPE JOINT, THEREBY, CAUSING THE CRACK. REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF SIMILAR DESIGNS IN THE SYSTEM, IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED ST. VINCENT WAS THE ONLY STATION THAT HAD THE ELBOW FLOW METER OUTSIDE A UNIT BUILDING. THE OTHER GLGT STATIONS HAVE THE ELBOW FLOW METERS INSIDE THE BUILDINGS AND NOT SUBJECTED TO SIMILAR CONDITIONS.     TRANSCANADA WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE PIPING ARRANGEMENTS WHERE FROST-SUSCEPTIBLE SOIL CONDITIONS MAY EXIST WITHIN THE GLGT SYSTEM UNDER THE THREAT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM."

SHORTLY BEFORE 11:51 AM CT, EPNG OPERATIONS CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF FLAMES ON THE EPNG RIGHT-OF-WAY (ROW) AND BY 12:16 PM CT HAD ISOLATED THE L3130 VALVE SECTION AND MONITORED PRESSURES ON THE ISOLATED SEGMENT AND CONFIRMED THAT THE PIPELINE WAS HOLDING PRESSURE.   AN EPNG OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR WENT TO THE SITE OF THE RUPTURE AT 12:20 PM CT AND VISUALLY CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS THE NAVITAS MIDSTREAM PARTNERS' LINE THAT HAD RUPTURED. EPNG WAS GETTING READY TO BLOW DOWN ITS LINE WHEN THE RUPTURE OF THE EPNG LINE OCCURRED. AT 12:33 PM CT, EPNG'S RTU DATA LOG AT JAMESON CHECK METER ON L3130 SHOWED A ""HIGH-HIGH"" ALARM.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30 PM CT.  AT APPROXIMATELY 12:44 PM CT, EPNG GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE EPNG OPERATIONS AT THE SITE STATING THAT ITS LINE HAD BEEN COMPROMISED.  THREE NAVITAS EMPLOYEES, A NAVITAS CONTRACTOR EMPLOYED BY QIS AND THE EPNG OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR WERE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. ONE NAVITAS EMPLOYEE LATER DIED FROM HIS INJURIES. TWO FIREFIGHTERS WERE TREATED AND RELEASED AT THE HOSPITAL THE SAME DAY, AS WAS ONE OF THE NAVITAS EMPLOYEES.  EPNG NOTIFIED THE NRC (NO. 1220198) AT 13:29 PM CT OF THE INCIDENT INVOLVING EPNG'S L3130 WITH AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY OF GAS RELEASED AND POSSIBLY CAUSED BY A FIRE ON A THIRD PARTY PIPELINE WITHIN THE ROW.     THE NRC LOGGED THE REPORT AT 13:46 PM CT. EPNG PROVIDED A 48-HOUR NOTICE TO THE NRC (NO. 1220423) ON AUGUST 3, 2018 AT 11:51 CT TO UPDATE INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT, ESTIMATED VOLUME OF UNINTENTIONAL NATURAL GAS RELEASED, AND A REPORT RECEIVED FROM THE OPERATOR OF THE THIRD PARTY PIPELINE THAT ONE OF ITS EMPLOYEE'S INJURIES WERE FATAL.  EPNG ISSUED ANOTHER REVISED NOTICE NRC (NO. 1220429) TO CORRECT THE TOTAL VOLUME OF UNINTENTIONAL NATURAL GAS RELEASED. THE CORRECT RELEASE VOLUME WAS 1,060 MSCF AT THE TIME OF THE 48 HOUR NOTICE.       THE INVESTIGATION UTILIZED THE METALLURGICAL DATA COLLECTED FROM THE EVENT AND THE DNV SYSTEMATIC CAUSE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE (SCAT) ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS TOOL PER KINDER MORGAN/EPNG PROCEDURES TO DETERMINE BASIC CAUSE, ROOT CAUSE AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.    BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION REPORT, WHICH WAS PROVIDED TO PHMSA, THE BASIC/ROOT CAUSES WERE DETERMINED TO BE ""12.1 INADEQUATE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE"" - PER THE METALLURGY FINDINGS, THE NAVITAS LINE WAS LEAKING EVEN PRIOR TO THE RUPTURE. NAVITAS HAD NOT IDENTIFIED THE LEAK, THE SELECTIVE ERW SEAM CORROSION, NOR CONDUCTED REPAIRS/MAINTENANCE AND . ""14.4 INADEQUATE MONITORING OF COMPLIANCE"" - AFTER THE NAVITAS LINE RUPTURED, NAVITAS PERSONNEL DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE NAVITAS LINE WAS BURNING AND ARGUED WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM KINDER MORGAN/EPNG, WHO TRIED TO TELL NAVITAS PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE THAT IT WAS THE NAVITAS LINE OBSERVED TO BE ON FIRE.  THE INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE INITIAL RUPTURE LOCATION WAS AT THE NAVITAS H-LOOP (NPS 6) LINE AND IT CONTINUED TO BURN FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT UNTIL THE EVENING OF AUGUST 3, 2018. DURING THIS TIME, NAVITAS REPORTED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE FUEL FOR THE FIRE COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. NAVITAS THOUGHT THE CAUSE MAY HAVE BEEN A LEAKING TAP VALVE, AND SO THEY WERE VERIFYING THAT THEIR VALVES WERE NOT LEAKING; ALSO NAVITAS LOOKED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL TAPS (INTERCONNECTS) THAT WERE NOT ON THEIR MAPS AND MAY HAVE BEEN FUELING THE FIRE."

THIS LOCATION IS IN HARDY COUNTY, MATHIAS, WV, GPS COORDINATES 38.875, -78.859.    AS PART OF THE TRANSCANADA WB EXPRESS PROJECT, AN INSTALLATION OF A STOPPLE FITTING WAS BEING COMPLETED BY THE CONTRACTOR (TD WILLIAMSON).  THE ORIGINAL FITTING WAS INSTALLED IN 2017 .  DURING THIS OPERATION, THE TD WILLIAMSON TECHNICIAN REMOVE THE COMPLETION PLUG AND INSTALL THE STOPPLE/BYPASS. THE 24"" BLIND FLANGE WAS REMOVED AND THE FITTING SNIFFED FOR GAS.  HE THEN INSTALLED A DEVICE /ADAPTER ONTO THE COMPLETION PLUG. THE STOPPLE VALVE ( SANDWICH VALVE) WAS INSTALLED. THE TAPPING MACHINE WAS THEN INSTALLED. THE TDW TECHNICIAN BEGAN TO HOOK UP HYDRAULIC UNIT TO THE TAPPING MACHINE TO PULL THE 24"" COMPLETION PLUG.  HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF REMOVING THE PLUG HE INFORMED THE TRANSCANADA AND BICON EMPLOYEES (PRIMARY CONTRACTOR) THAT HE NEEDED TO RESET THE MACHINE AND TO DO SO HE NEEDED TO BLOW DOWN THE GAS PRESSURE OFF THE MACHINE. HE THEN OPENED THE BLOW OFF VALVE AND BEGAN BLOWING DOWN, THE GAS BLEW THOUGH THE BLOWDOWN VALVE FOR A FEW SECONDS WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF DIMINISHING, THEN THE TOP BLEW OFF THE MACHINE AND ALLOWED FULL LINE PRESSURE TO ESCAPE TO THE OPEN ATMOSPHERE.  THE EXHAUSTING GAS BLEW SEVERAL MACHINE PARTS OUT THE TOP OF THE MACHINE.     NO INJURIES OCCURRED AND THE PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED BY MANUALLY CLOSING MAINLINE VALVES.  THE AREA AT THE STOPPLE WAS CLEARED AS THE GAS WAS RELEASED.  NO STRUCTURES (APPROX. 250')OR ROADS (APPROX. 175') WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA.  THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED, HELPING DIRECT VEHICLE TRAFFIC AND FIVE RESIDENCE WERE EVACUATED.  THE INITIAL PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS 840 PSIG AND IS NOW BLOWN DOWN AND ISOLATED.  THE MAOP IS 870 PSIG.    A ROOT-CAUSE INVESTIGATING WAS JOINTLY CONDUCTED BY TRANSCANADA AND TD WILLIAMSON. IT WAS DETERMINED THE TD WILLIAMSON TECHNICIAN DID NOT PROPERLY FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THE COMPLETION PLUG.  DURING THE INITIAL PLUG REMOVAL PROCESS, THE TECHNICIAN BECAME CONCERNED THAT THE RETRIEVAL WAS NOT GOING AS EXPECTED. THE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO RE-SET THE COMPLETION PLUG,  IMPLEMENTED A STOP WORK, AND CONTACTED A TDW SME FOR GUIDANCE. WHILE THE TECHNICIAN RECEIVED GUIDANCE, HE DID NOT EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE THE FULL DEPTH AND BREADTH OF THE SITUATION. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT WHILE ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THE COMPLETION PLUG, THE PLUG HAD NOT BEEN FULLY REMOVED FROM ITS GROOVES AND HAD ONLY BEEN PARTIALLY RESET (WINGS NOT FULLY ENGAGED). AFTER RECEIVING GUIDANCE, THE TECHNICIAN DECIDED THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO BLOW DOWN THE TAPPING MACHINE, REMOVE IT, AND INVESTIGATE THE PLUG EXTRACTION ASSEMBLY. AT THIS TIME, THE PRESSURE IN THE TAPPING MACHINE WAS EQUALIZED WITH PIPELINE PRESSURE AT 800-PSI. THE BLOWDOWN PROCEDURE CREATED A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE COMPLETION PLUG. AS THE COMPLETION PLUG WINGS WERE NOT FULLY ENGAGED INTO THE PLUG FITTING GROOVES, THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACTING ACROSS THE PARTIALLY SET COMPLETION PLUG, CAUSED IT TO BE RELEASED FROM ITS POSITION. THE COMPLETION PLUG THEN IMPACTED THE BORING BAR AND FORCED IT THROUGH THE TOP OF THE TAPPING MACHINE."

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARRIVED AT THE 80-W VALVE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 23:13 AND THE MECHANICS SIMULTANEOUSLY CLOSED THE VALVES AT 80-W AND MCBAIN CITY GATE TO ISOLATE THE GAS FLOW TO THE DEHYDRATION UNIT.  THE FIRE CONTINUED AS THE AS THE PIPELINE DEPRESSURIZED AND THEN WAS EXTINGUISHED.  THERE WERE NO FATALITIES OR INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.    THE MCBAIN FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON SCENE AND PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION DETERMINED A LIGHTNING STRIKE TO BE THE CAUSE.   CONSUMERS ENERGY ALSO RECEIVED A REPORT FROM STRIKENET© CONFIRMING THE PRESENCE OF 22 CLOUD-TO-GROUND LIGHTNING STRIKES WERE DETECTED WITHIN 2 MILES OF THE PROPERTY ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2018.     NEW VALVES WERE INSTALLED ON THE WELL LINES (R-178 AND R-179) AND A TEMPORARY HOSE TO THE 2"" BLOWDOWN FOR THE LINE THAT SUPPLIES THE MCBAIN CITY GATE WAS INSTALLED. THE LINE WAS RE-PRESSURIZED ON SEPTEMBER 3, 2018 AT APPROXIMATELY 04:44.  THE INCIDENT RESPONSE AND TEMPORARY REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED WITH NO CUSTOMER IMPACT AND/OR LOSS OF SERVICE.    THE INLET AND OUTLET VALVES TO THE DEHYDRATION UNIT WERE BLIND FLANGED AND THE SYSTEM WAS BYPASSED TO SUPPLY THE LAKE CITY AND MCBAIN CITY GATES.  AN ACTION PLAN WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PREPARE FOR WINTER OPERATIONS.    AN INTERNAL TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED TO COMPLETE A ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION AND IDENTIFY COUNTERMEASURES TO MINIMIZE FUTURE OCCURRENCES.      A ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE WAS AT OR NEAR THE DEHYDRATION UNIT AND MAY HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE AT A KIMRAY CONTROLLER CAUSING THE FUEL TRAIN REGULATOR TO CONTINUE TO FEED THE FUEL TO THE BURNER, LEADING THE DIETHYLENE GLYCOL TO BOIL OVER AND IGNITE.   HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THE EXACT CAUSE REMAINS UNDETERMINED.     THE DEHYDRATION UNIT WAS IN-SERVICE WHILE THE RIVERSIDE STORAGE FIELD WAS SHUT IN.  LEAVING THE UNIT IN SERVICE ALLOWS CONSUMERS ENERGY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE REQUIRED QUALITY OF GAS TO THE CITY GATES.    SEVERAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEVERITY OF THE INCIDENT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE ROOT CAUSE REPORT AND ACTION ITEMS TO PREVENT RE-OCCURRENCE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED."

THE ESD WAS CAUSED BY A COMMERCIAL POWER DISRUPTION. THE EMERGENCY GENERATOR STARTED THOUGH A CIRCUIT BREAKER TRIPPED CAUSING A LOSS OF ELECTRICAL POWER WHICH RESULTED IN FULL STATION ESD ACTIVATION. WHEN THE ESD OCCURRED, GAS VENTED THROUGH THE THREE STATION ESD BLOW DOWN VALVES BECAUSE 30""X 24"" (VALVE 19-149) FAILED TO CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY.  OPERATOR PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED VALVE 19-149 AT 5:01 PM EST. TOTAL GAS LOSS THROUGH THE THREE ESD BLOW DOWN VALVES WAS CALCULATED TO BE 23.24 MMSCF.  WHEN THE ESD SYSTEM ACTIVATED, THE CONTROL PILOT ASSEMBLY IN THE SHAFER ACTUATOR FOR VALVE 19-149 FROZE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF WATER (EXTERNAL TO THE CONTROL) AND COLD AMBIENT TEMPERATURES WHICH CAUSED THE VALVE TO REMAIN OPEN.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:  48 HR NRC REPORT 1231234    PRIOR TO THE NOVEMBER 23, 2018 INCIDENT AT TETLP'S LILLY COMPRESSOR STATION, TETLP HAD CALCULATED THE ESTIMATED GAS LOSS FOR A NORMAL ESD EVENT AT LILLY STATION TO BE 1.23 MMSCF.  BASED ON THIS CALCULATION, AN ESD OPERATING AS ANTICIPATED WOULD NOT BE REPORTABLE, SINCE THE GAS RELEASE WOULD BE WELL UNDER THE 3 MMSCF THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING.  HOWEVER, ONE OF THE ESD ISOLATION VALVES UNEXPECTEDLY DID NOT CLOSE PROPERLY, SO THE ACTUAL GAS LOSS WAS GREATER THAN THE ESTIMATED 1.23 MMSCF, AND GREATER THAN THE 3 MMSCF REPORTING THRESHOLD.  ON NOV. 24, THE ESTIMATED GAS LOSS WAS CALCULATED TO BE MORE THAN 3 MMSCF, AND THEN WAS REPORTED TO NRC.

(REFER TO MPSC STAFF' INVESTIGATION REPORT APPENDIX A)    FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE DET-TRONICS FAILURE LEADING TO THE FIREGATE ACTIVATION REVEALED THAT A GROUNDING FAULT WAS THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE INITIAL FIREGATE EVENT. WHEN THE STATION'S [DOMESTIC WATER] WELL PUMP STARTED UP, ITS VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVE CAUSED A VOLTAGE SPIKE IN THE GROUNDING SYSTEM OF THE DET-TRONICS PANEL LOCATED IN THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING. THESE HIGH VOLTAGES CAUSED ENHANCED DISCRETE INPUT/OUTPUT (EDIO) AND ANALOG INPUT MODULE (AIM) TO LOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE DET-TRONICS PILOT AIR SYSTEM, A FAULT WHICH TRIGGERED THE INITIAL FIREGATE.    TO ELIMINATE THE GROUNDING VOLTAGE INTO THE DET-TRONICS SYSTEM, THE WELL PUMP PRESSURE SWITCH AND  PRESSURE TRANSMITTER WERE RELOCATED TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE PLANT 3 AUXILIARY BUILDING.

THE ON DUTY OPERATOR NOTICED THAT THE STATION CONTINUED TO BLOW DOWN BEYOND DURATION OF A NORMAL SHUTDOWN AND CALLED THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR AND STATION PERSONNEL FOR ASSISTANCE IN LOCATING THE SOURCE OF THE CONTINUAL GAS RELEASE. THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR ARRIVED ON SITE AND TOGETHER WITH THE OPERATOR AND STATION PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THAT THE STATION HEADER SUCTION VALVE, AS-1, AND DISCHARGE VALVE, AD-3, HAD NOT CLOSED AS DESIGNED. THE OPERATOR AND THE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL (OPERATIONS SPECIALIST) MANUALLY CLOSED THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES AND STOPPED THE GAS RELEASE AT 2:45AM ON JANUARY 31, 2019. THE STATION VENTED FOR A TOTAL OF 37 MINUTES AND THE TOTAL GAS RELEASE WAS 55,924 MCF.  THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ESD PUSH BUTTON 5 HAD HAD MOISTURE ENTER THE CASING AND CAUSED CORROSION ON THE BUTTON. ON THE DAY OF THIS EVENT, THE EXTREMELY COLD TEMPERATURES (-4 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT) CAUSED THE MOISTURE IN THE CASING TO FREEZE THEREFORE OPENING THE CIRCUIT ON THE BUTTON AND INITIATING THE ESD. IN ADDITION, MOISTURE HAD GOTTEN IN TO THE AS-1 SUCTION VALVE ACTUATOR AND AD-3 DISCHARGE VALVE ACTUATOR AND THE EXTREMELY COLD WEATHER CAUSED THE VALVE O-RINGS TO FREEZE, PREVENTING THEM FROM CLOSING. IN ORDER TO PREVENT A REOCCURRENCE OF THESE EVENTS THE PUSH BUTTON WAS REPLACED AND FRYQUEL 300 WAS ADDED TO THE VALVE ACTUATORS ON AS-1 AND AD-3 TO ENSURE THEY ARE SEALING TIGHTLY AND WATERTIGHT.

THE FIRST VISUAL OBSERVATION OF THE RELEASE POINT IDENTIFIED THAT FOUR FACTORY INSTALLED BOLTS USED TO HOLD THE LOWER TRUNNION TO THE BALL VALVE WERE FOUND BROKEN OFF. THE UNINTENTIONAL AMOUNT OF GAS RELEASED WAS 600.3 MCF. TO REPAIR THE ISSUE THE DAMAGED VALVE WAS REMOVED AND BLIND FLANGES WERE INSTALLED ON BOTH ENDS OF THE PIPELINE. ON 02/24/2019 THE LINE WAS PURGED AND PUT BACK INTO SERVICE. THE ABNORMALLY HIGH REPAIR COSTS WERE DUE TO SNG CHOOSING TO MOBILIZE ITS CONTRACTOR AND WORK THROUGH THE WEEKEND TO MAKE THE REPAIRS SO THAT THE PIPELINE SYSTEM COULD BE RESTORED TO FULL CAPACITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THUS MINIMIZING THE IMPACT TO DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS. THE ESTIMATED COST FOR REPAIRING THIS ISSUE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IS $40,000.     AFTER A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, THE FAILURE OF THE BOLTS WAS DETERMINED TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT, IN THE FORM OF HYDROGEN-STRESS CRACKING. THE TENSILE STRENGTH AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE BOLTS CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASTM A193 GRADE B7 MATERIAL. HOWEVER, THE BOLTS DID NOT MEET THE ASTM A193 B7 HARDNESS SPECIFICATION. THE BOLTS HAD A HARDNESS OF 40 HRC, WHICH EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM ASTM A193 B7 HARDNESS REQUIREMENTS OF 35 HRC. THE HARDNESS CONDITION INCREASED THE MICROSTRUCTURE'S SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HYDROGEN CRACKING. NO EVIDENCE OF OVER-TORQUING, STRESS CORROSION CRACKING, OR OTHER METALLURGICAL IRREGULARITIES WAS FOUND.     48-HR NRC REPORT UPDATE NUMBER IS 1238409."

DCP PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 AM MST AND CONFIRMED A GAS RELEASE AND ISOLATED THE LINE. DCP PERSONNEL BLEW DOWN REMAINING PRESSURE IN THE LINE. INITIAL INVESTIGATION INDICATED A CRACK IN THE PIPE AT APPROXIMATELY THE 6-O'CLOCK POSITION IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO A GIRTH WELD TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE.     BASED ON INVESTIGATION AND METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, DCP HAS DETERMINED THAT THE BZ-7-1-2-EXT CLASS 2 GAS GATHERING PIPELINE FAILED DUE TO CYCLIC FATIGUE CAUSED BY EXTERNAL LOADING.  THE BZ-7-1-2-EXT PIPELINE RUNS PARALLEL TO A COUNTY ROAD AND UNDERNEATH AN INTERSECTION WITH A SECOND COUNTY ROAD.   AS PART OF A COUNTY ROAD EXPANSION PROJECT IN AUGUST 2015, A HEAVY CONCRETE PRE-FABRICATED DRAINAGE CULVERT AND SUPPORT BRACE WERE INSTALLED DIRECTLY OVER AND WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF THE TOP OF THE PIPELINE AT THE INTERSECTION.  DCP HAD LOCATED AND MARKED THE PIPELINE IN JULY 2015 IN RESPONSE TO AN 811 NOTIFICATION FOR THE ROAD PROJECT, BUT DCP WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH THE COUNTY'S CONSTRUCTION PLANS PRIOR TO THE WORK BEING DONE, AND WAS NOT AWARE NOR MADE AWARE OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CULVERT INSTALLATION AND THE PIPELINE.  FREQUENT HEAVY VEHICLE TRAFFIC AT THE INTERSECTION SUBSEQUENTLY APPLIED REGULAR CYCLIC LOADING TO THE CONCRETE CULVERT AND CONCRETE SUPPORT BRACE UNDER THE ROADWAY, WHICH CYCLIC LOADING CAUSED A BENDING FRACTURE AND THEN FINAL DUCTILE OVERLOAD TEAR OF THE GATHERING PIPELINE IMMEDIATELY BELOW, RESULTING IN THE FAILURE OF THE BZ-7-1-2-EXT PIPELINE ON OR IMMEDIATELY BEFORE APRIL 2, 2019.        THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SEGMENT HAS BEEN PURGED OF ALL HYDROCARBONS, PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTED FROM ALL SOURCES OF GAS, AND CAPPED.

THE POTENTIAL LEAK WAS DISCOVERED DUE TO BUBBLING WATER IN THE DITCH.  NO VISIBLE HYDROCARBON SHEEN WAS NOTED, INDICATING A PROBABLE NON-HYDROCARBON GAS LEAK.    THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 12TH, LYONDELL TESTED THEIR AREA GAS PIPELINES AND DETERMINED THAT LYONDELL WAS NOT THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  LATER THAT DAY, CITGO TESTED THE N11 (PURCHASED H2) PIPELINE, NB7 (AIR LIQUIDE) PIPELINE, AND FINALLY THE N02 (#5 PLAT H2) PIPELINE.    THE N02 PIPELINE WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  WHEN THE N02 LINE WAS DE-PRESSURED, THE BUBBLING IN THE DITCH SUBSIDED.    THE SCADA SYSTEM WAS FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATING UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  THE PIPELINE PRESSURE DROP DUE TO THE FAILURE WAS SO SMALL THAT IT DID NOT INDICATE ON THE CONTROL ROOM SCADA SCREEN AT THE PRESSURE POINT ADJACENT TO THE LEAK AREA.     THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION WAS CALLED AND NOTIFIED OF THE LEAK AT 12:55 AM ON NOVEMBER 13, 2018.     THE N02 LINE WAS DE-PRESSURED TO THE POINT WHERE THE BUBBLING STOPPED (NOON ON NOVEMBER 13TH) AND A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO ISOLATE THE LINE WHILE MINIMIZING EMISSIONS FROM THE WEST PLANT DUE TO H2 CONTAINMENT FROM THE #5 REFORMER.  AN ADDITIONAL ISOLATION VALVE ON THE N02 LINE AT CITGO VALVE STATION C WAS INSTALLED IN ORDER TO ISOLATE THE N02 LINE FROM THE N11 LINE.    HYDRO-EXCAVATION WAS ATTEMPTED TO UNCOVER THE LEAK LOCATION BUT, DUE TO SOIL INSTABILITY, THE DEPTH OF THE EXCAVATION (OVER 25 FOOT), AND ITS PROXIMITY TO I-37, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO ABANDON THIS ACTIVITY AND BACKFILL THE EXCAVATION.    QUEST INTEGRITY WAS CONTRACTED TO SMART PIG THE N02 LINE.  RESULTS FROM THE UT ILI SMART PIG IDENTIFIED 5 AREAS OF CONCERN.  ALL LOCATIONS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE AND AT LOW LYING AREAS.    NO PROPERTY DAMAGE OCCURRED DUE TO THE INCIDENT, EITHER CITGO OR PROPERTY OF OTHERS.    THE LEAK RESULTED IN 1.7 MMSCF OF GAS RELEASED TO ATMOSPHERE    AN NRC CALL (REPORT #1242400) WAS MADE ON 4/10/19 AT 16:23    AN NCR 48-HOUR UPDATE (RENEWED REPORT #1242587) WAS MADE ON 4/12/19 AT 13:38    THE RE-ROUTE OF A PORTION OF THE N02 LINE IS NOW ALMOST COMPLETE.

PRAXAIR PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON THE SITE AT 1830 AND CONFIRMED THAT HYDROGEN WAS PRESENT IN THE AREA.  THE LOCATION WAS IN AN ISOLATED AREA.  MANUAL ISOLATION VALVES WERE SHUT TO CLOSE IN THE SEGMENT AND IT WAS MANUALLY BLOWN DOWN.  AT 0852 ON 6 MAY 2019, PRAXAIR DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT MET REPORTABLE CRITERIA AND CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 0922.  BLOWDOWN OF THE ISOLATED SEGMENT WAS COMPLETED AT 1230 ON 6 MAY 2019.      THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZABLE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT.  NO EXCAVATORS WERE OPERATING IN THE AREA, AND CP TESTING SHOWED NO ABNORMALITIES.  THE SUSPECTED AREA OF THE LEAK WAS EXCAVATED, BUT THE PIPE WAS SHOWN TO BE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS MOST LIKELY LOCATED UNDERNEATH A SMALL NON-NAVIGABLE DRAINAGE CANAL.  UNABLE TO EXCAVATE UNDER THE WATER, A NEW SEGMENT OF PIPE WAS INSTALLED, REROUTING AROUND THE LEAK.  THE PIPELINE WAS PUT BACK INTO SERVICE ON 12 MAY 2019 AT 0930.      IN JUNE 2019, THE INACTIVE SEGMENT OF PIPE WAS FURTHER INVESTIGATED WITH A TETHERED INLINE INSPECTION (ILI) TOOL IN ORDER TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK.  RESULTS SHOWED AN ANOMALY IN THE VICINITY OF A GROUNDING ROD FOR A NEARBY ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION TOWER.  AN ADDITIONAL DCVG INSPECTION SHOWED A SIMILAR ANOMALY, CORRELATING THE RESULTS OF THE ILI.  IT IS THEREFORE SUSPECTED THAT LIGHTNING STRUCK THE TOWER DURING A STORM, CREATING A SURGE OF ENERGY THAT RELEASED INTO THE GROUND THROUGH THE GROUNDING ROD.  THIS ELECTRICAL ENERGY CREATED THE ANOMALY ON THE PIPE WHICH EVENTUALLY LED TO THE SMALL LEAK.      THE NEWLY INSTALLED SEGMENT OF PIPE IS NOT LOCATED IN THE VICINITY OF THE GROUNDING ROD.  AN EXTERNAL INSPECTION COMPANY WAS HIRED TO REVIEW PIPELINE LOCATIONS WITH SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTS THROUGHOUT THE PIPELINE SYSTEM.  NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE DISCOVERED AND A SIMILAR INCIDENT IS NOT SUSPECTED TO OCCUR AGAIN."

A 48 HOUR FOLLOW UP CALL WAS PROVIDED TO THE NRC ON 5/4/2019 AT 14:54 (NRC# 1244649).     THE FAILURE INVESTIGATION IS ON-GOING.     ------UPDATE------    BASED ON EXAMINATIONS AND ANALYSIS BY STRESS ENGINEERING, IT WAS DETERMINED THE PIPE FAILED AS A RESULT OF NEAR-NEUTRAL PH STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC) IN CONCERT WITH GENERAL EXTERNAL CORROSION THAT REDUCED THE WALL THICKNESS NEAR THE 6 O'CLOCK ORIENTATION OF THE PIPE.     THE PIPELINE CONTINUES TO BE OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL ALL OF THE 30"" IS HYDROTESTED.       ------UPDATE------    THE LINE HAS BEEN FULLY HYDROTESTED AND WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON FEBRUARY 2, 2020.    09/25/2019 SUPPLEMENTAL   A.10 GAS LOSS VOLUME UPDATED.

THE TRACTOR PLANTER RAN THROUGH A STEEL BARRICADE AND OVER COLORADO INTERSTATE GAS (CIG) TRANSMISSION'S LINE 4B ABOVEGROUND VALVE STEM/OPERATOR.  THIS CAUSED THE VALVE FLANGE TO PULL APART BELOWGROUND AND RELEASE NATURAL GAS.  THE FARMER SHUT DOWN THE TRACTOR AND REMOVED HIMSELF FROM THE SCENE.  CIG OPERATIONS PERSONNEL SECURED THE SITE AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO THREAT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC SINCE THE OCCURRENCE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD, AWAY FROM ANY POPULATED AREAS.  THE NEED TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS RESULTED IN ALLOWING THE GAS TO CONTINUE TO RELEASE UNTIL A BYPASS COULD BE CONSTRUCTED AND INSTALLED.  FOLLOWING THIS, ISOLATION VALVES WERE CLOSED AND THE PIPELINE WAS BLOWN DOWN TO ALLOW REMOVAL OF THE TRACTOR PLANTER AND REPAIR OF THE FACILITY.  THE FACILITY WAS RESTORED TO SERVICE MAY 15, 2019.

THE INCIDENT LOCATION WAS ADJACENT TO A COLUMBIA PIPELINE, LINE 4010, WHICH IS PART OF A 13.88-MILE GATHERING SYSTEM THAT TRANSPORTS GAS FROM PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN JEFFERSON AND CLARION COUNTIES, PENNSYLVANIA, TO A COMPRESSOR STATION IN RIMERSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA.  THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION ORIGINALLY APPROVED COLUMBIA'S ACQUISITION OF LINE 4010 IN 1971, AND THE PIPELINE REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION UNDER THE NATURAL GAS ACT.    COLUMBIA'S RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE SECTION ADJACENT TO THE INCIDENT LOCATION WAS REPLACED IN 1982 USING 0.156-INCH WALL THICKNESS, 6-INCH NPS CARBON STEEL PIPE WITH AN EXTRUDED POLYETHYLENE COATING.  COLUMBIA'S RECORDS ALSO INDICATE THAT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE OF LINE 4010 WAS 50 PSIG, PRODUCING A HOOP STRESS THAT IS LESS THAN 20 PERCENT OF SPECIFIED MINIMUM YIELD STRENGTH OF THE LINE PIPE, AND THAT THE OPERATING PRESSURE WAS 32 PSIG.  COLUMBIA'S RECORDS FURTHER INDICATE THAT THE SECTION ADJACENT TO THE INCIDENT LOCATION WAS NOT PART OF A REGULATED GATHERING LINE, ALTHOUGH PHMSA AND COLUMBIA ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THAT DETERMINATION.    COLUMBIA OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE INCIDENT LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 11:10 P.M.  A RESIDENCE AT THE LOCATION SUSTAINED FIRE-RELATED DAMAGE, AND AN OCCUPANT SUSTAINED INJURIES NECESSITATING IN-PATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.  ANOTHER SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING IN THE VICINITY WAS EVACUATED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.  AS PART OF ITS INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT, COLUMBIA SURVEYED THE AREA TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL LEAK SOURCES, ISOLATED THE AFFECTED SECTION, AND TOOK OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS IN COOPERATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.   COLUMBIA ALSO SUBMITTED INCIDENT REPORTS TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) ON MAY 29, 2019 (NRC REPORT NO. 1247157), AND MAY 31, 2019 (NRC. REPORT NO. 1247379).    A THIRD PARTY, ECHELON- APPLIED GEOSCIENCES CONSULTING, CONDUCTED A STRAY GAS ORIGIN STUDY AS PART OF COLUMBIA'S INCIDENT INVESTIGATION.  THE STUDY REVEALED THAT THE STRAY GAS IN THE SOILS IN THE VICINITY OF THE INCIDENT LOCATION WAS OF THE SAME GENETIC ORIGIN AS THE GAS IN LINE 4010, AND THAT THERE WAS A FEASIBLE PATHWAY FOR LEAKING GAS TO MIGRATE FROM LINE 4010 TO THE RESIDENCE.  HOWEVER, THE STUDY ALSO INDICATED THAT STRAY GAS DETECTED IN THE SOILS WAS OF THE SAME GENETIC ORIGIN AS GAS FROM A NEARBY WELL (API # 37-031-00978), WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION BY THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (PADEP).  ANOTHER THIRD PARTY, KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES (KIEFNER), PREPARED A ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS (RFCA) FOR COLUMBIA.  IN THE RCFA, KIEFNER CONCLUDED THAT A LEAK IN LINE 4010 BENEATH PINE RUN ROAD WAS THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR OF FUEL TO THE FIRE AT THE RESIDENCE, AND THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY EXTERNAL CORROSION.  HOWEVER, KIEFNER ALSO NOTED THAT TWO OTHER POTENTIAL COMBUSTIBLE GAS SOURCES WERE PRESENT IN THE AREA: (1) A THIRD-PARTY METER STATION LOCATED TO THE SOUTH OF THE RESIDENCE, WHICH WAS LEAKING AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, AND (2) A THIRD-PARTY WELL LOCATED ON A NEIGHBORING PROPERTY WITH GAS GEOCHEMISTRY THAT WAS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE GAS IN LINE 4010.  KIEFNER COULD NOT OFFER A CONCLUSIVE DETERMINATION ABOUT THE POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF THESE OTHER GAS SOURCES ON THE INCIDENT.    COLUMBIA IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT KIEFNER INCLUDED IN THE RCFA TO PREVENT THE POTENTIAL RECURRENCE OF A SIMILAR INCIDENT.  COLUMBIA HAS COOPERATED WITH THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND WILL UPDATE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS REPORT IF ADDITIONAL RELEVANT MATERIAL BECOMES AVAILABLE."

AT THE TIME OF THE NRC CALL, 11:02AM, THE FIRE HAD DIED OUT. PRIOR TO THE EVENT, THE STATION WAS OFF-LINE AND ISOLATED FOR MAINTENANCE. THIS THEREFORE MINIMIZED THE AMOUNT OF GAS LOSS.    THE INVESTIGATION IN TO THE INCIDENT WAS INCONCLUSIVE ON THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE INCIDENT WERE DETERMINED TO INCLUDE THE PRESENCE OF A FLAMMABLE ATMOSPHERE AND IRON SULFIDE IN THE FILTER SEPARATOR AND INADEQUATE PROCEDURES. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THERE WAS NEITHER A MANUFACTURERS NOR A SITE-SPECIFIC PROCEDURE FOR PURGING AND PACKING THE FILTER SEPARATOR UNITS. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS NOT A MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE FOR CLEANING OUT OF THE ACCESSIBLE SECTIONS OF THE FILTER SEPARATORS, LEADING TO AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF SOLID BUILD UP, INCLUDING IRON SULFIDE. IN ORDER TO PREVENT A REOCCURRENCE, A PURGE VALVE WAS ADDED TO THE DOWNSTREAM SECTION OF FILTER SEPARATORS #1 AND #3 (ONE ALREADY EXISTED ON #2) TO MAKE THE PURGING SEQUENCE REQUIRED ON EACH SEPARATOR SIMILAR.

AREA PERSONNEL ARRANGED FOR HELICOPTER, FLEW OVER AREA, AND CONFIRMED BUBBLES ON JUNE 19 AT APPROXIMATELY 09:10. NRC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE AND LINE WAS ISOLATED AND PRESSURED DOWN TO 0 PSIG. ON JUNE 21, A SONAR INSPECTION WAS DONE BUT WATER WAS AT A HIGH LEVEL WITH THE EAST BANK RIGHT-OF-WAY FLOODED AND INACCESSIBLE. DUE TO THE WATER MOVEMENT AND FLOODING IT WAS UNSAFE FOR DIVING OPERATIONS; INCIDENT SITE IS APPROXIMATELY 80 FEET BELOW WATER. MULTIPLE SONAR PASSES WERE RECORDED FROM APPROXIMATELY THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER TOWARD THE WEST BANK WHERE THE SUSPECTED LEAK IS LOCATED. SONAR INDICATES THERE MAY BE A POSSIBLE EXPOSURE ON THE HELENA 12"" #1 LINE (HEL 12-1). IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS SECTION OF THIS LINE WILL BE ABANDONED.    9-6-19 EMAIL RECEIVED FROM PHMSA INDICATED THAT THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE INDICATED ON THIS REPORT DOES NOT FALL ON THE REFERENCED MAPPED PIPELINE.  THIS PIPELINE IS UNDER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND THE LOCATION PROVIDED IS WHERE BUBBLES WERE FOUND IN THE WATER; THIS IS THE MOST ACCURATE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE LINE IS STILL SHUT IN.     ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE PIPE OR A WELD, TO ACCOMMODATE PHMSA'S REQUEST FOR PIPE DATA, THE ANSWERS PROVIDED IN PART C HAVE CHANGED FROM ""ITEM INVOLVED IN INCIDENT = UNKNOWN,"" TO ""ITEM INVOLVED IN INCIDENT = PIPE.""    REGARDING THE COSTS AND ABANDONMENT, COST HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM $5,000,000 TO $1,400,000 BECAUSE TEXAS GAS ORIGINALLY EXPECTED TO REPAIR THE LINE BUT INSTEAD WILL CHECK THE INTEGRITY OF THE HEL 12-2 (PARALLEL LINE) AND CONSIDER ABANDONING THE HEL 12-1; IF THIS APPROACH IS USED, PIG TRAPS MAY ALSO BE INSTALLED.    CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.  THIS LINE IS OUT OF SERVICE AND THE LOCATION IS UNDER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.  NO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO CAUSE IS PLANNED.    11-14-19 UPDATE: TEXAS GAS WILL INVESTIGATE USING A DIVING TEAM. AT THIS TIME, THE CAUSE REMAINS UNKNOWN. ADDITIONALLY, TEXAS GAS PLANS TO PERFORM AN INLINE INSPECTION ON THE PARALLEL LINE.    3-25-2020 DIVERS WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT.  THE PIPELINE INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT HAS NOW BEEN ABANDONED IN PLACE. A SECOND REDUNDANT PIPELINE IN THE SAME RIGHT-OF-WAY WAS MODIFIED AND INLINE INSPECTED TO ENSURE ITS INTEGRITY. INLINE INSPECTION SHOWED THIS PIPELINE IS FIT FOR SERVICE. SUBSEQUENTLY, GAS WAS RE-ROUTED TO THIS PIPELINE TO PROVIDE SERVICE. TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WOULD REQUIRE PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE ABANDONED PIPELINE.  DOING SO WOULD REQUIRE DIVERS TO JET OUT APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET OF SILT FROM THE RIVER BOTTOM.  THIS ACTION WOULD NOT ONLY POSE SIGNIFICANT RISK TO PERSONNEL BUT COULD POSSIBLY JEOPARDIZE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SECOND PIPELINE NOW IN SERVICE."

THE LINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 7/4/2019.       KIEFNER PERFORMED AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK. THE REPORT WAS DATED AUGUST 29, 2019. THE SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION OF THE REPORT STATED ""THE LEAK THAT OCCURRED ON THE LOREED-LUDINGTON PIPELINE IN THE MLV 4-5 VALVE SECTION ON JUNE 30, 2019 WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY CORROSION WHICH THINNED THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS TO THE POINT THAT THE REMAINING LIGAMENT WAS UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE STRESS INDUCED BY THE INTERNAL PRESSURE. THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE WALL WAS BY DUCTILE TEARING AND THE APPEARANCE OF A CRACK-LIKE FEATURE WAS CAUSED BY THE LOCALIZED NECKING OF THE MATERIAL JUST PRIOR TO TEARING.  AN AREA OF COATING DAMAGE AND DISBONDMENT, WHICH CAUSED CATHODIC SHIELDING OF THE PIPE MATERIAL, LIKELY ENABLED THE CORROSION TO OCCUR. THE PRESENCE OF A TWO PART FULL-ENCIRCLEMENT SWAMP WEIGHT OVER THE LEAK LOCATION LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR DISBANDED COATING TO SHIELD THE PIPE MATERIAL.  THE TYPE OF CORROSION THAT OCCURRED AT THIS LOCATION CAN BE DESCRIBED AS 'UNDER DEPOSIT ACID ATTACK.' HOWEVER, THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE CORROSION WAS NOT IDENTIFIED.

WHEN THE ALARM WAS DETECTED, A TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE COMPRESSOR STATION TO INVESTIGATE. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SITE AT 09:35 CDT, THE TECHNICIAN DISCOVERED NATURAL GAS BEING RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH THE VENT STACKS.  IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS TAKEN BY VERIFYING NO FIRE EXISTED AND CLOSING THE VALVES OPEN TO ATMOSPHERE, WHICH ENDED THE RELEASE AT 09:43 CDT.  UNINTENTIONAL GAS LOSS WAS CALCULATED TO 99 MILLION CUBIC FEET (MMCF).     NO PROPERTY DAMAGE OR INJURIES WERE DOCUMENTED, AND NO MANDATORY EVACUATIONS WERE REQUIRED.  THE CAUSE OF THE UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO A FLAME DETECTION EQUIPMENT (FIRE EYE) ACTIVATION THAT INITIATED THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) SYSTEM. WHEN THE SYSTEM INITIATED, SEVEN ESD VALVES DID NOT FULLY OPERATE ALLOWING GAS TO CONTINUE TO VENT UNTIL PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AND ISOLATED THE SYSTEM.  NO INDICATION OF FIRE WAS OBSERVED IN THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING.    THE FLAME DETECTOR UNIT WAS SENT TO THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER FOR EVALUATION.  THE MANUFACTURER REPORTED THAT THE DETECTION UNIT MET ALL MANUFACTURING SPECIFICATIONS AND OPERATED AS INTENDED.  THE MANUFACTURER ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THE UNIT'S SENSITIVITY BE REDUCED FROM ""HIGH"" TO ""MEDIUM"" AND INCREASE THE ACTIVATION DELAY FROM 8 SECONDS TO 10 SECONDS.  THESE RECOMMENDED CHANGES ARE DUE TO THE OPERATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION IN THE RECIPROCATING ENGINE COMPRESSOR BUILDING.  THE CHANGE IN SENSITIVITY AND TIMING DOES NOT AFFECT THE SAFETY OF THE PIPELINE FACILITY AND THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN TESTED ACCORDING TO PROCEDURES.  THE CHANGES TO THE FLAME DETECTION EQUIPMENT WAS COMPLETED ON 26 JULY 2019.    INVESTIGATION INTO ESD VALVES DETERMINED THAT PILOT GAS WAS NOT VENTED COMPLETELY UPON AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION.  EVEN THOUGH THE ESD SYSTEM HAD ACTIVATED AND STARTED TO VENT PILOT GAS, PRESSURES THROUGH THE SUPPLY LINE MAINTAINED ENOUGH PRESSURE TO PREVENT THE VALVES FROM FULLY MOVING TO THE CLOSED POSITION.  TO REDUCE THE PILOT GAS SUPPLY, A SMALLER 1/32"" ORIFICE PLATE WAS INSTALLED INTO THE SUPPLY LINE ON AUGUST 14, 2019, REDUCING THE FLOW OF GAS AND RECHARGE TIME INTO THE SUPPLY SYSTEM.   THE PURPOSE OF THE ORIFICE IS TO MAINTAIN PILOT GAS PRESSURE IN THE EVENT OF A MINOR LEAK TO PREVENT AN UNINTENDED ESD.  THE ESD SYSTEM HAS BEEN INSPECTED AND TESTED ACCORDING TO PROCEDURES SINCE THE ORIFICE REPLACEMENT AND OPERATED CORRECTLY.  THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN PLACED BACK INTO FULL SERVICE.  IN ADDITION TO THE ORIFICE CHANGE, FIVE EMERGENCY VALVES WILL BE UPGRADED WITH NEW THREE-WAY PILOT VALVE ASSEMBLIES AND THE END-OF-STROKE VALVE ON TWO OTHER VALVES WILL BE REPLACED, WHICH WILL ENSURE PROPER OPERATION OF THE VALVES.  THE ADDITIONAL UPGRADES TO THE VALVES ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 120 DAYS."

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND REMEDIATION  THE NEW PRESSURE RELIEF/SAFETY VALVE (PSV) WAS INSTALLED ON 10/25/2018 WITH THE ORIGINAL VENDOR PILOT FILTER AND TUBING ATTACHED TO THE PSV.  THE VENDORS PSV DESIGN HAD THE PILOT FILTER SUPPORTED SOLELY BY THE TUBING CONNECTING THE FILTER TO THE RELIEF VALVE PILOT.  THE TUBING FAILED AT THE CONNECTION TO THE PSV PILOT.  THIS FAILURE APPEARS TO BE DUE TO VIBRATION INDUCED FATIGUE FROM THE UNSUPPORTED WEIGHT OF THE PILOT FILTER AND THE FAILURE EVENT WAS REVIEWED WITH THE VENDOR.  WILLIAMS-TRANSCO HAS REPLACED THE PILOT TUBING AND REMOTE MOUNTED THE PILOT FILTER FOR BETTER SUPPORT WHICH SHOULD PREVENT ANY FUTURE FAILURE FROM OCCURRING.  THE TUBING AND PILOT FILTER INSTALLATION WILL BE MONITORED FOR NORMAL OPERATION AND VIBRATION."

THIS SEGMENT OF LINE 134 IS MECHANICALLY COUPLED, PLACED INTO SERVICE IN 1929 WITH A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE OF 250 PSIG. ON AUGUST 21, 2019 LINE 134 WAS SUBJECT TO A MECHANICAL COUPLING FAILURE OCCURRING IN ARMSTRONG COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA. THE MORNING OF AUGUST 21ST, GAS CONTROL RECEIVED AN ALARM FROM THE IOWA COMPRESSOR STATION INDICATING THAT UNIT 1 HAD HIGH DISCHARGE PRESSURE. STATION PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED AND RESPONDED TO THIS CALL. LATER THAT HOUR GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A SECOND ALARM FROM THE IOWA COMPRESSOR STATION INDICATING THAT UNIT 2 HAD LOW SUCTION PRESSURE. THIS CALL WAS ALSO RESPONDED TO AND EVALUATED. PIPELINE PRESSURE CONTINUED TO DROP. OPERATIONS MANAGERS WERE NOTIFIED, AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING COMPANY PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED. THE PIPELINE LEAK WAS LOCATED AND ISOLATED BY 7:58 AM.    THE PIPELINE IN THIS AREA IS PART OF A MODERNIZATION PROJECT. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THE EFFECTED SEGMENT OF LINE 134 IN THIS PROJECT HAD BEEN EXPOSED, STOPPLES INSTALLED, PIPELINE SECTIONS REMOVED, AND END CAPS WERE INSTALLED. THE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES DURING THIS CONSTRUCTION WORK APPEAR TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DISCONNECTION OF THIS SECTION OF PIPE.    INITIAL NRC REPORT NUMBER IS 1255871 REPORTED AUGUST 21, 2019 AND THE 48-HOUR NRC REPORT NUMBER IS 1256125 REPORTED ON AUGUST 23, 2019.    THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INCIDENT HAS DETERMINED THE FOLLOWING CAUSAL FACTORS:  -GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF MECHANICAL COUPLINGS RESIDED WITHIN CPG INTEGRATED DOCUMENTS LISTING    BUT NOT WITHIN THE TC ENERGY CONTROLLED DOCUMENT LIBRARY; THE SINGLE REFERENCE SOURCE FOR US NATURAL GAS PIPELINES PROJECTS.  -DURING PROJECT PLANNING THE RISKS OF EXCAVATION ON 1929 VINTAGE PIPELINE SYSTEM WITH PROBABILITY FOR MECHANICAL COUPLINGS WAS NOT DOCUMENTED AS A POTENTIAL HAZARD FOR EXCAVATION/CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES.  -WHEN A MECHANICAL COUPLING WAS EXPOSED DURING EXCAVATION, THE RISK WAS NOT ADEQUATELY ESCALATED BY THE CONTRACTOR TO THE PROJECT MANAGER.  ADDITIONALLY, THE DECISION TO MOVE THE STOPPLE INSTALLATION POINT DUE TO MECHANICAL COUPLING DISCOVERY AT THAT POINT DID NOT GENERATE DISCUSSION ON THE RISK OF THE EXPOSED MECHANICAL COUPLING OR THE POTENTIAL OF ADDITIONAL MECHANICAL COUPLINGS NEAR THE EXCAVATION SITE.       CORRECTIVE ACTIONS COMPLETED TO DATE INCLUDE:  -ESTABLISHED US NATURAL GAS PROJECTS INITIATIVE TO IDENTIFY GAPS IN EXISTING ENGINEERING DESIGN STANDARDS  -REQUIRE ALL PROJECTS TO DEVELOP A PRE-JOB SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN    -THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ""MECHANICAL PIPELINE REPAIR TAPPING AND JOINING"" PROCEDURE TO US NATURAL GAS PROJECT, US CONSTRUCTION SERVICES STAFF, US GAS OPERATIONS FIELD OPERATIONS MANAGERS AND TEAM LEADERS  -PUBLICATION OF THE ""MECHANICAL PIPELINE REPAIR TAPPING AND JOINING"" PROCEDURE TO THE CONTROLLED DOCUMENT LIBRARY   -ESTABLISHED REQUIRED TRAINING FOR US NATURAL GAS PROJECT CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS AND US GAS OPERATIONS FIELD OPERATIONS STAFF ON ""MECHANICAL PIPELINE REPAIR TAPPING AND JOINING"" PROCEDURES.   -DISTRIBUTED LESSONS LEARNED SAFETY SHARE TO US NATURAL GAS PIPELINES PROJECTS, CONSTRUCTION SERVICES AND US GAS OPERATIONS FIELD OPERATIONS.    -ADDITIONAL TRAINING PLANNED IN 2021"

PERSONNEL INVESTIGATED THE AREA WITH A HELICOPTER AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE GAS BUBBLES COMING TO THE SURFACE OVER GENESIS 30"" GAS PIPELINE. PERSONNEL MADE NOTIFICATIONS AND ISOLATED THE PIPELINE SEGMENT. THERE WAS NO SHEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT.  DIVE CREW ARRIVED ON THE SCENE FOR REPAIRS WITH A CLAMP.  THE DIVERS DESCRIBED THE ENVIRONMENT AS HAVING POOR VISIBILITY BUT DESCRIBED RELEASE POINT AS A THIN ""SPLIT.""  UT MEASUREMENTS TAKEN NEAR THE RELEASE SITE INDICATED LITTLE TO NO METAL LOSS ON THE PIPE EXCEPT IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE SPLIT.  AFTER THE TEST, THE PIPE WAS PRESSURED UP AGAIN WITHOUT ANY LEAKAGE.    PART E, QUESTION 5C - THIS SEGMENT IS ISOLATED BY CLOSING 3 UPSTREAM VALVES AND ONE DOWNSTREAM VALVE.  THE DISTANCE REPORTED IN THIS QUESTION IS THE LONGEST DISTANCE BETWEEN VALVES USED.  PART G:  EARLY ANALYSIS APPEARS TO POTENTIALLY POINT TO SOME TYPE OF CORROSION EVENT HOWEVER, DUE TO THE DEPTH OF THE PIPE AND THE POOR VISIBILITY ON THE SEA FLOOR, THE DATA AVAILABLE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE WHETHER IT IS INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL AT THIS TIME.  GENESIS WILL COLLABORATE WITH A THIRD PARTY SME TO AID IN THE DETERMINATION.    SUPPLEMENTAL (11/18/2020) - AFTER CONSULTING WITH A THIRD PARTY CORROSION EXPERT, GENESIS BELIEVES THE LEAK WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY INTERNAL CORROSION, HOWEVER IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF INTERNAL CORROSION IS RESPONSIBLE WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE.  PRIOR TO REPAIRING THE LEAK SITE, DIVERS CONDUCTED SEVERAL UT SCANS OF THE RELEASE AREA, BOTH CIRCUMFERENTIALLY AND UPSTREAM/DOWNSTREAM FROM THE RELEASE SPOT.  THE TESTS SHOWED METAL LOSS ONLY AT THE SPOT OF THE SPLIT BUT NOWHERE ELSE THAT WAS SCANNED.  FURTHER ASSESSMENT IS NOT POSSIBLE SINCE VISIBILITY ON THE SEA FLOOR IS VERY POOR AT THIS SIGHT AND ALSO, THE SEGMENT IS NOT ILI PIGGABLE DUE TO THE DIFFERING PIPE DIAMETERS OF THE CONNECTING UPSTREAM PIPELINES.    SINCE AT THIS TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVENT WAS CAUSED BY INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL CORROSION, GENESIS HAS COMPLETED SEVERAL MITIGATING TECHNIQUES TO ENHANCE THE CATHODIC PROTECTION OF THIS SEGMENT.  FIRST, GENESIS HAS INSTALLED AN ADDITIONAL SACRIFICIAL ANODE ON THIS SECTION OF PIPE.  SECOND, AN ADDITIONAL WATER TRAP AND CORROSION COUPON HAVE BEEN INSTALLED ON HIA 582.  FINALLY, GENESIS INTENDS TO RECOMMEND TREATMENT MEASURES FOR THE UPSTREAM OPERATOR TO FURTHER PROTECT THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENTS."

THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE ON BCSC LINE 4 FROM AN ABOVEGROUND 3-INCH PIPELINE CONNECTING A METER STATION IN THE AREA TO STORAGE WELL 12-3 (OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A ""WELL LEAD"").     FOLLOWING AN INVESTIGATION, PRELIMINARY FINDINGS POINTED TO LOSS OF INTERNAL PIPE WALL THICKNESS IN THE 3-INCH PIPE CAUSED THE PIPE TO RUPTURE AND BREAK APART. SAMPLES OF THE PIPE WERE SUBMITTED FOR METALLURGICAL TESTING AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE WAS DUE TO EROSION (AS INDICATED IN PART G1).     DURING THE NATURAL GAS RELEASE BETWEEN 0.7 AND 0.9 BARRELS OF LIQUIDS, CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF WATER AND DISTILLATE, WERE ALSO RELEASED UNDER HIGH PRESSURE.  DUE TO THE HIGH PRESSURE OF THE RELEASE, THE LIQUIDS WERE RELEASED IN A BROAD AREA ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE. THE SURFACE OF THIS ENTIRE AREA WAS TREATED WITH BIO-AMENDMENTS.

THE SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT DATED 12/11/19, PROVIDES FURTHER CLARIFICATION/CORRECTIONS FOR THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS:    PART A, QUESTION 10. THE ESD SYSTEMS OPERATED AS DESIGNED. THERE WAS A STATION YARD BLOCK VALVE OUTSIDE THE ESD SYSTEM THAT WAS INADVERTENTLY OPEN THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE AMOUNT RELEASED.     PART E, QUESTION 7. RECEIVED AN ESD SAFETY STATUS ALARM FOR THE FUEL METER AT EPPS STATION THAT THE CONTROLLER ACKNOWLEDGED IMMEDIATELY. THE COMMUNICATIONS AT EPPS STATION WENT DOWN THE SAME TIME AS THE ESD TRIPPED. GAS CONTROL COULD NOT SEE A PROBLEM UNTIL THERE WAS A PRESSURE DROP AT THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM LOCATIONS. COMMUNICATIONS WERE OUT AT THE STATION SO THE CONTROLLERS WERE NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM AN ACTUAL ESD. CONTROLLERS REVIEWED UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PRESSURES AND THERE WERE NO NEGATIVE RATE OF CHANGE ALARMS PRESENT. UPSTREAM PRESSURE STARTED TO SHOW A SLOW DECLINE IN PRESSURE. LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPT CALLED IN A FEW MINUTES LATER AND REPORTED THERE WAS GAS BLOWING AT THE STATION. THE CONTROLLERS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED FIELD PERSONNEL TO THE SCENE AND STARTED AN EVERBRIDGE CONFERENCE BRIDGE TO ALERT MANAGEMENT AND FIELD PERSONNEL IN THE AREA.     PART E, QUESTION 8. UPDATED YES, BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION NO CONTROLLER ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED.    PART H, THE UPS FOR THE ESD SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT IS SIZED TO MAINTAIN POWER FOR A MINIMUM OF 4 HOURS AND WE HAVE A BACK-UP GENERATOR THAT WILL COME ON-LINE WHEN THERE IS A LOSS OF COMMERCIAL POWER ACROSS THE WHOLE STATION. THE BREAKER THAT TRIPPED WAS SUPPLING POWER TO THE CONTROL BUILDING ONLY, WHERE THE ESD CONTROLS AND COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT IS LOCATED. IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOSS OF COMMERCIAL POWER OF THE WHOLE STATION THE GENERATOR WOULD HAVE STARTED AUTOMATICALLY AND GAS CONTROL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED AN ALARM. THE UPS BATTERIES WOULD NOT HAVE RUN DOWN. THE STATION YARD BLOCK VALVE WAS IDENTIFIED AND LOCKED CLOSED. AN ALARM HAS BEEN INSTALLED TO NOTIFY GAS CONTROL IF THERE IS A FUTURE POWER LOSS AT THIS CONTROL BUILDING TO PREVENT RECURRENCE."

GULF SOUTH INVESTIGATED AND DETERMINED THERE WAS A MECHANICAL COUPLING LEAK ON ITS INDEX 205 (8"" LINE) IN IBERIA PARISH, LOUISIANA. AFTER LOWERING THE PRESSURE BY 20% (270 PSI TO 215 PSI) AND MONITORING THE AREA NEAR THE LEAK WITH LEL EQUIPMENT, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK COULD BE MONITORED UNTIL A REPAIR PLAN WAS FORMULATED. BECAUSE IT WAS A COUPLING, A PRESSURIZED WELD OVER SLEEVE WOULD HAVE TO BE INSTALLED TO CORRECT THE LEAK. FOR BUSINESS REASONS, THE LINE WOULD NEED TO BE ISOLATED WITH STOPPLE FITTINGS AND DE-PRESSURED AND THE CUSTOMERS LOCATED WITHIN THE AFFECTED AREA SERVED BY A TEMPORARY BYPASS INSTALLED ON AN ADJACENT GULF SOUTH PIPELINE. ONCE THE LINE WAS DE-PRESSURED, THE WELD OVER SLEEVE COULD BE SAFELY INSTALLED. ON 11-5-19, WHEN THAT DECISION WAS MADE, THE REPAIR COSTS WERE THEN EXPECTED TO EXCEED THE $50,000 INCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA AND THE NRC WAS CALLED. THE NRC NOTIFICATION FOR THIS INCIDENT WAS ONLY MADE BECAUSE OF ESTIMATED REPAIR COSTS.

THE FAILURE OCCURRED NEAR THE GIRTH WELD AREA OF A REPAIRED SECTION OF PIPE. THE PIPE WAS INSTALLED THE PREVIOUS DAY TO REMOVE AN ANOMALY DISCOVERED BY AN ILI TOOL RUN.  THE FAILED SECTION WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO PRECISION ENGINEERING FOR ANALYSIS. NRC INITIAL 11/14/2019 (NRC # 1263945). 48 HR FOLLOW UP 1/15/2019 (NRC# 1264007).  07.10.2020 SUPPLEMENTAL. PRECISION ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS, LLC WAS CONTRACTED TO PERFORM A FAILURE INVESTIGATION FOR ENABLE ON CRACKING AND LEAKING ASSOCIATED WITH A GIRTH WELD IN THE WESTLINE SYSTEM THAT JOINED TWO PIPE MATERIALS: 18"" .281"" (OLD PIPE) AND 18"" .375"" (NEW PIPE). THE OLD PIPE WAS INSTALLED IN 1950, WHILE THE NEW PIPE WAS INSTALLED IN 2019. THE DIMENSIONAL EXAMINATION SHOWED THAT THE PIPE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GIRTH WELD MET THE DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPLICABLE API 5L AND 5LX SPECIFICATIONS FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE DATES OF MANUFACTURE AND SIZES. THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE NEW PIPE MET THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS API 5L, BUT THAT THE OLD PIPE DID NOT, DUE TO HIGH CARBON, PHOSPHOROUS, AND CARBON EQUIVALENCY. IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT THERE WERE NO CHEMICAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS FOR X52 LINE PIPE AT THE TIME OF THE MANUFACTURE OF THE OLD PIPE (1950). THE HARDNESS TESTING CONDUCTED DID NOT SHOW ANY ABNORMALITIES IN THE HARDNESS OF THE PIPES, HEAT AFFECTED ZONES, OR WELD METAL. THE MAGNETIC PARTICLE INSPECTION OF THE I.D. SURFACE SHOWED CRACK INDICATIONS ON THE OLD PIPE SIDE OF THE GIRTH WELD AROUND THE ENTIRE CIRCUMFERENCE. THE MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION SHOWED LACK OF FUSION ORIGINATING AT THE I.D. BETWEEN THE OLD PIPE AND THE ROOT PASS WELD METAL. DUCTILE OVERLOAD FRACTURE WAS FOUND NEAR THE O.D. AND THROUGH-WALL IN SOME REGIONS. A VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE OF THE THROUGH WALL CRACK SHOWED LACK OF FUSION PRESENT AROUND MOST OF THE I.D. SURFACE WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE BEING DUCTILE OVERLOAD. THE LACK OF FUSION IS THOUGHT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH WELDING PARAMETERS AND WELDING TECHNIQUE. ALTHOUGH THE CARBON CONTENT AND CARBON EQUIVALENCE OF THE OLD PIPE WAS HIGH AND IN EXCESS OF CURRENT API 5L REQUIREMENTS, IT IS NOT THOUGHT TO BE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRESENCE OF ELEVATED STRESSES GENERATED DURING THE TIE-IN PROCESS CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED, ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY WHAT MAGNITUDE OF STRESS MIGHT HAVE EXISTED AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. ALL TIE IN WELDS ON THE WESTLINE REMEDIATION PROJECT WERE NON-DESTRUCTIVELY TESTED WHEN COMPLETED. WELDS TI-9 AND TI-10 (NEW PIPE) WERE TESTED AND PASSED BY A LEVEL II TECHNICIAN. THE TECHNICIAN'S PAPERWORK STATED THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE MINIMUM GUIDELINES SET FORTH IN API 1104. AFTER THE INCIDENT, THE X-RAY FILM FOR TI-9 AND TI-10 WAS SENT TO A 3RD PARTY X-RAY COMPANY FOR A QUALITY CONTROL CHECK.  THE 3RD PARTY FOUND THE FILM DENSITY TO BE LESS THAN THE REQUIRED RANGE OF 1.8 - 4.0 THAT API 1104 AND ENABLE MIDSTREAM CONSTRUCTION SPEC CS-095 REQUIRE. FIVE OF THE SIX X-RAY SHOTS FOR TI-9 AND TI-10 WERE BELOW THE MINIMUM DENSITY REQUIREMENT OF 1.8. DENSITY BELOW 1.8 COULD POSSIBLY CAMOUFLAGE A FEATURE, IF PRESENT. DUE TO FILM DENSITY BEING OUT OF SPEC, ENABLE DISQUALIFIED THE X-RAY TECH.   7/30/20 SUPPLEMENTAL. BOTH WELDERS THAT PERFORMED THE WELDS WERE QUALIFIED AT THE TIME OF THE TIE-IN. BOTH HAD BEEN OBSERVED FOLLOWING THE WELDING PROCEDURE PRIOR TO THE FAILURE. AFTER THE FAILURE, A WELDER REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED AND THEY WERE NOT DISQUALIFIED. OF THE THREE X-RAY REVIEWS AFTER THE INCIDENT, ONLY ONE WELD WAS FOUND TO BE OUT OF SPEC (TI-10) FOR WHICH IT WAS REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY, X-RAYED, AND FOUND PASSING. WELD TESTING WAS PERFORMED AND CONFIRMED THE WELDING PROC. USED WAS ADEQUATE. ALONG WITH WELD TESTING, AND LEVEL III TECH REVIEWS, ENABLE WILL PERFORM AN ASSESSMENT APPROPRIATE FOR CRACK-LIKE DEFECTS ON THE WESTLINE HCAS, MCAS AND CLASS 3 LOCATIONS DURING THE NEXT REASSESSMENT CYCLE."

HE NOTICED A GAS RELEASE SOUND UPON EXITING HIS VEHICLE NEAR THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING. THE TECH REPORTED THE ISSUE TO THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THE LEAK. HE IDENTIFIED IT WAS COMING FROM THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER AS THE TECH COULD VISUALLY SEE THE GAS VENTING AND ALSO OBSERVED FROSTING ON THE SILENCER. THE TECH THEN PROCEEDED TO THE CONTROL ROOM AND ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIED THAT THE NORMALLY CLOSED REMOTED OPERATED 4IN COMPRESSOR LOADING VALVE WAS OPEN ON THE UNIT #2 LOAD LINE ALLOWING GAS TO VENT THROUGH THE NORMALLY OPEN COMPRESSOR VENT VALVE. THE TECH PROCEEDED TO CLOSE THE MANUAL BLOCK VALVE ON THE LOAD LINE ASSEMBLY AT 1:36PM TO STOP THE LEAK. THE LEAK STOPPAGE WAS REPORTED TO KM MANAGEMENT AT 1:40PM. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, IT WAS UNKNOWN THE QUANTITY OF GAS RELEASED BUT ON THE 2:35PM ERL CALL IT WAS DETERMINED TO REPORT TO THE NRC AS A PRECAUTION. IT WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC AT 2:46PM LOCAL TIME WITH THE UNKNOWN AMOUNT. THE REPORT NUMBER WAS 1264245.    48 HOUR UPDATE:  DURING INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE GAS HAD BEEN VENTING THROUGH THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER FOR ABOUT 6 DAYS. THIS WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC (#1264366) ON THE 48 HR UPDATE AT 4:54PM LOCAL TIME ON 11/19/19.    INVESTIGATION:  DURING INVESTIGATION, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE UNIT #2 LOAD LINE VALVE OPENED ON 11/12/19 AT 11:43PM. THE LOAD LINE VALVE OPENED AS A RESULT OF FREEZING UP OF MOISTURE IN THE SOLENOID CONTROL BOX. AT STA 856, THE TEMPERATURE ON 11/12/19 WENT BELOW FREEZING AT 4PM AND WAS APPROXIMATELY 22 °F AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THIS AREA DOES HAVE WINTERIZATION PROCEDURES AND PLANS IN PLACE AND IS SCHEDULED IN MAXIMO TO BE PERFORMED MONTHLY NOVEMBER THROUGH MARCH. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS OCCURRED MID-MONTH, THE PLAN WAS NOT COMPLETED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.    THE TIMING OF THE EVENT IS VALIDATED BY THE VALVE EVENT LOGS, THE ALARMS, AND THE PRESSURE RISE IN THE UNIT #2 PIPING AT THAT TIME OF THE EVENT. THE PRESSURE ON THE DISCHARGE OF UNIT #2 WHERE THE VENT VALVE IS LOCATED AVERAGED 135 PSI. THIS BACKPRESSURE FLUCTUATED WITH THE MAINLINE LINE PRESSURE AND WAS CREATED BY THE RESTRICTION OF AN ORIFICE PLATE ON THE INLET TO THE SILENCER. THE ORIFICE PLATE ON THE SILENCER IS A DESIGNED PLATE WITH 4 X 1.25"" HOLES FOR CUTTING THE PRESSURE GOING INTO THE SILENCER. WHEN CALCULATING GAS LOSS IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE ORIFICE PLATE ACTED AS 4 INDEPENDENT HOLES. THE TOTAL GAS LOSS CALCULATED WAS 116,172 MCF.    THE GAS THAT PRESSURIZED THE UNIT #2 COMPRESSOR CASE ALSO PRESSURIZED THE UNIT #1 CASE. WHEN THE PLC SAW THE CASE PRESSURE ELEVATED ON UNIT #2, IT TRIGGERED THE UNIT TO TRY TO MAINTAIN SEAL OIL PRESSURE TRIGGERING ALARMS AND EVENT STATUSES. OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENT THERE WERE 3 STATION WARNING CALLOUTS THAT WERE TRIGGERED THROUGH ALARMS ORIGINATING FROM THE LOAD LINE VALVE OPERATING. THESE ALARMS INDICATED ISSUES WITH UNIT 1 AND UNIT 2 IN RELATION TO THE SEAL OIL SYSTEMS. THE TECH RESPONDING TO THE CALLOUTS LOGGED IN REMOTELY TO ASSESS THE SCADA ALARMS. THE TECH VIEWED ONLY THE STATION LEVEL ALARM SCREEN AND UNIT 1A ALARM SCREEN, AND EITHER DIDN'T LOOK AT OR DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EVENTS. THE TECH ALSO DIDN'T LOG INTO THE UNIT 2A LEVEL MACHINES TO VIEW THE UNIT SPECIFIC ALARM SCREEN. IN ADDITION TO THE 2 EVENTS ON THE NIGHT THE INCIDENT ORIGINATED THERE WAS ALSO A CALLOUT 3 DAYS LATER AGAIN AS A RESULT OF A UNIT 2A ALARM THAT WAS NOT FOLLOWED UP ON.    FOLLOW-UP ACTION ITEMS:  OPERATIONS HAS CHANGED THE MAXIMO WORK ORDER TO BEGIN WINTERIZATION PLANS IN OCTOBER INSTEAD OF NOVEMBER.    ALSO, THE TECH WAS PREVIOUSLY TRAINED ON SCADA AND HOW TO MANAGE ALARMS; HOWEVER AFTER THIS INCIDENT, OPERATIONS HELD RE-TRAINING FOCUSING ON ALARM LOG REVIEW AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT RESPONSES. THE TECH IN QUESTION HAD OQ REVOKED AND WAS REQUIRED TO RETEST FOR THE OQ TASK."

AT APPROXIMATELY 12:15 PM, THE EMPLOYEE NOTICED NATURAL GAS LEAKING OUT OF A BREATHER FITTING ON A COMPONENT OF THE ACTUATOR ON THE 10-INCH PRIMARY REGULATOR.    THE EMPLOYEE CALLED HIS SUPERVISOR WHO THEN INITIATED THE INTERNAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE (ERL) NOTIFICATIONS PER COMPANY PROCEDURES TO DISCUSS THE NATURAL GAS RELEASE EVENT. DURING THE CALL IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE AMOUNT OF GAS LOSS DID NOT MEET THE INCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA AND REPAIR COSTS WERE NOT EXPECTED TO REACH THE $50,000 REPORTING THRESHOLD.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEAK.    IN ORDER TO SECURE THE LOCATION, THE EMPLOYEE CHANGED PRIMARY REGULATION FROM THE LEAKING REGULATOR TO A SECONDARY REGULATOR IN ORDER TO CONTINUE SUPPLYING GAS TO DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS.  ONCE THE SECONDARY REGULATOR PICKED UP THE LOAD, THE UPSTREAM MONITOR VALVE AND DOWNSTREAM ISOLATION VALVES ON THE LEAKING PRIMARY REGULATOR RUN WERE SHUT AND SECURED USING COMPANY LOCKOUT/TAGOUT (LOTO) PROCEDURES ISOLATING THE PRIMARY REGULATOR RUN.

ON SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 2021, DIVERS ATTEMPTED A TEST FIT OF ENCLOSURE BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN CLOSING AND SEALING IT.    THE REASON THE ENCLOSURE FAILED WAS BECAUSE THE VALVE STEM WAS LARGER THAN THE STANDARD DRAWING THAT CAMERON PROVIDED FOR THE GROVE B5 USED FOR THE DESIGN OF THE ENCAPSULATION. A TEST LEAD PAD WAS DISCOVERED ON THE HOT TAP BRANCH WHERE THE STRONGBACK WAS TO BE PLACED AND COULD CAUSE INTERFERENCE. THIS TEST LEAD PAD WOULD NEED TO BE REMOVED IN A DRY ENVIRONMENT RATHER THAN WITH DIVERS IN ORIGINAL SCOPE. THE HOT TAP BRANCH WAS SLIGHTLY SHORTER FROM TOE OF WELD TO TOE OF WELD THAN WHAT WAS DEPICTED ON THE AS BUILT. THIS WAS A VERY MINOR DIFFERENCE, BUT ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY PREVENT CLEARANCE OF THE STRONGBACK.    ADDITIONALLY, DIVERS WERE ABLE TO VISUALLY IDENTIFY THAT A BODY RELIEF VALVE INSTALLED IN THE BODY BLEED PORT IS THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.

LINE 1655 IS A 10-INCH COATED CARBON STEEL TRANSMISSION PIPELINE WITH A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE OF 936 PSIG. THIS PIPELINE IS OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION, LLC (COMPANY) A TC ENERGY ENTITY WITH THE OPERATOR ID 2616.   NATURAL GAS SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM THE VENT PIPE AND A NEARBY METERING STATION ON LINE 1655, THEN SENT TO AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT THE SOURCE OF NATURAL GAS WAS FROM PIPELINE 1655.  A PRESSURE REDUCTION FROM 702 PSIG DOWN TO 600 PSIG WAS PUT IN PLACE TO MAINTAIN UNINTERRUPTED FLOW TO APPROXIMATELY 42,000 DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS THAT WERE SERVICED BY THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AND PHMSA ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION DIVISION WERE NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT (NRC# 1269937). PIPELINE STOPPLES AND BYPASS PIPING WERE INSTALLED AROUND THE LEAK AREA TO MAINTAIN NATURAL GAS FLOW DOWNSTREAM WHILE REPLACING THE PIPELINE THROUGHOUT THE ROAD CROSSING AREA. THIS WORK REQUIRED THE CLOSURE OF STATE ROUTE (SR) 74 AND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT AROUND THE AREA. EVIDENCE SECTION OF PIPE WAS SENT FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS BY AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY. ANALYSIS INDICATED STRAY CURRENT INDUCED EXTERNAL CORROSION AS A PROBABLE CAUSE.    AFTER COMPLETING PERMANENT REPAIRS, LINE 1655 WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON FEBRUARY 19, 2020.  ANTICIPATING ALTERNATING CURRENT (AC) STRAY CURRENT AS A PROBABLE CAUSE, A TEMPORARY SOLID-STATE DE-COUPLER WAS INSTALLED BETWEEN LINE 1655 AND THE SR 74 CASING. AN ADDITIONAL FIVE CASINGS WERE CONNECTED TO THE PIPELINE THROUGH SOLID STATE DE-COUPLERS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MITIGATION AGAINST AC DENSITY ON LINE 1655.   IN JANUARY 2021, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN AC STUDY REPORT AND MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTOR. AFTER REVIEWING THE REPORT, THE COMPANY REQUESTED ADDITIONAL MODELING TO BE COMPLETED USING A MORE STRINGENT AC DENSITY THRESHOLD DUE TO COMPANY PROCEDURES THAT HAVE BEEN UPDATED SUBJECT TO THE ADDITIONAL STRINGENT STANDARD.   AS OF MARCH 31, 2021, THE NEWLY INTRODUCED MODELING IS ONGOING. ONCE COMPLETED, A PROJECT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO INSTALL THE ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED, TEMPORARY MITIGATION IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE ON 1655 TO HELP MITIGATE AC CONCERNS.  MODELING WAS RECENTLY COMPLETED FOR 1655. THE MODELING INDICATED UNMITIGATED (WITHOUT THE TEMPORARY MITIGATION MEASURES IN PLACE) STEADY STATE VOLTAGES OVER 15 VAC AS WELL AS CURRENT DENSITIES OVER 30 A/M2.      JANUARY 2022, THE AC VOLTAGE STUDY WAS COMPLETED, A NEW MITIGATION PROJECT IS IN PROCESS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PERMITTING STAGES TO INSTALL APPROXIMATELY 4,500 FEET OF MITIGATION RIBBON ALONG THE PIPELINE, SIX FAULT MITIGATION ELECTRODES, ADDITIONAL COUPON TEST STATIONS, CONVERSIONS OF ALL TEST STATIONS IN THE AREA TO ""DEAD FRONT"" TEST STATIONS, AND APPROXIMATELY 15 GRADIENT CONTROL MATS AT EXISTING TEST STATIONS.  THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY GROUNDED THROUGH SOLID STATE DECOUPLERS TO EXISTING CASINGS TO MITIGATE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH AC CURRENT DENSITY AND INDUCED AC POTENTIALS.  THESE TEMPORARY MEASURES WILL BE DISCONNECTED UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT.  THE TEMPORARY MEASURES DO NOT AFFECT THE CATHODIC PROTECTION OF THE PIPELINE. PROJECT COMPLETION IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR Q3 2022.  PLEASE NOTE QUESTION E1A. WOULD NOT ACCEPT 12140 (MSCF/D) AS AN ENTRY FOR FLOW RATE. THE FLOW RATE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN ENTERED AS 12.14 (MMCF/D)."

THE PILOT IN THE EMERGENCY BLOWDOWN VALVE WAS REPLACED.   AFTER INVESTIGATING, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PILOT ACTUATOR OF THE EMERGENCY BLOWDOWN VALVE HAD A LEAKING SEAL ON THE POWER GAS SIDE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ESCAPING GAS FROM THE SEAL MADE ITS WAY TO THE VENT WHERE IT FROZE OVER THE EXHAUST PORT, PREVENTING THE LEAKING GAS FROM REACHING ATMOSPHERE. THE PRESSURE FROM THE LEAKING GAS CONTINUED TO BUILD, AND UPON REACHING 150 PSI THE VALVE OPERATOR ACTIVATED TO ITS ""SAFE STATE"" AS IT IS DESIGNED TO DO, AND IN THIS CONFIGURATION THE SAFE STATE HAS THE VALVE IN THE OPEN POSITION. THE VALVE OPERATOR'S SAFE STATE CONFIGURATION RESULTED IN THE EMERGENCY BLOWDOWN VALVE OPENING WITHOUT SNG'S COMMAND.   BEFORE THE EVENT, SNG HAD IDENTIFIED THE VALVE OPERATOR AS LEAKING AND MADE PLANS TO ADDRESS THE LEAK, BUT DUE TO NOT BEING AWARE OF THIS OPERATOR'S FAIL SAFE MODE AN INCORRECT ASSESSMENT OF THE TIMEFRAME FOR REPAIR WAS MADE.

THE FAILED SECTION WAS LOCATED IN A SEASONAL CREEK 12"" UNDERGROUND AND THE FAILURE OCCURRED NEAR THE 12 O'CLOCK AREA OF THE PIPE.  THE FAILED SECTION WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO PRECISION ENGINEERING FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED ON 3/26/2020 (NRC # 1274308). A 48 HR FOLLOW UP CALL WAS PROVIDED TO THE NRC ON 3/28/2020 (NRC # 1274411).  ENABLE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS HAS NOT RECEIVED THE RESULTS OF THE LAB ANALYSIS. THE FAILURE INVESTIGATION IS ON-GOING.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________THE LAB ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON THE RUPTURED LINE PIPE INDICATE THAT THE INITIATION OF THE FRACTURE WAS DUE TO DUCTILE OVERLOAD. THE WALL THICKNESS OF THE LINE PIPE IN THE REGION OF THE FACTURE WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN REDUCED DUE TO HEAVY O.D. CORROSION AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION (TOP OF LINE). THE WALL IN THIS REGION WAS REDUCED (WALL THICKNESS RANGING FROM 0.013 INCH TO 0.088 INCH MEASURED NEAR RUPTURE) TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE HOOP STRESS GENERATED BY THE INTERNAL LINE PRESSURE (225 PSIG). BY USING THE BARLOW'S FORMULA AND THE TENSILE STRENGTH OBTAINED IN THE MECHANICAL TESTING, IT IS CALCULATED THAT WITH AN INTERNAL PRESSURE OF 225 PSIG AND A TENSILE STRENGTH OF 66,542 PSI, RUPTURE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO OCCUR AT A WALL THICKNESS OF APPROXIMATELY 0.027.    THE ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON THE FAILED SECTION OF LINE N SHOW EXTENSIVE O.D. CORROSION OF THE TOP PORTION OF THE PIPE. WALL THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS CONFIRMED THE WALL LOSS WAS CONFINED TO THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE PIPE. THIS SECTION OF LINE N WAS LOCATED IN A SEASONAL CREEK AREA WHERE THE PIPE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN 8-12 INCHES BELOW THE SURFACE PRIOR TO FAILURE. WHEN FULLY EVACUATED, STANDING WATER COULD BE SEEN INSIDE THE FAILED PIPE SEGMENT. THE GAS IN LINE N IS TARIFF QUALITY GAS INDICATING WATER WAS PRESENT ABOVE THE PIPE PRIOR TO RUPTURE. IT IS DETERMINED THAT 70 YEARS OF SEASONAL EXPOSURE TO WATER AND ATMOSPHERE, WITH COATING DETERIORATION  AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION, REDUCED THIS SECTION OF PIPE TO WHERE IT COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE HOOP STRESS GENERATED BY THE INTERNAL LINE PRESSURE (225 PSIG).  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  THE FAILED SECTION OF LINE HAS NEVER BEEN EXPOSED. ALONG WITH ANNUAL PATROLS THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE INSPECTIONS ON THIS LINE. A CLOSE INTERVAL SURVEY WAS PERFORMED IN 2016 AND THE CREW DID NOT SEE ANY PIPE EXPOSED AND IN 2018 THE OPS SOUTHERN DIVISION LAUNCHED AN EXPOSED PIPE INITIATIVE. DURING THIS INITIATIVE THE FAILED SECTION WAS NOT SEEN OR DETERMINED TO BE EXPOSED. THERE WAS AN EXPOSURE ROUGHLY 700 FEET TO THE NORTH OF THE FAILURE SITE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN 2006. THE EXPOSURE WAS ENTERED INTO MAXIMO, WORK ORDERS FOR INSPECTION WERE REGENERATED, AND THE COATING WAS REPAIRED IN 2013. THE SITE CONTINUES TO BE INSPECTED TODAY WITH WORK ORDERS BEING GENERATED FOR FOLLOW UP. IF THE FAILED SECTION WAS ABOVEGROUND,  OR VISIBLE,  WE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT. THE EXPOSURE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE SAME INSPECTION PROCESS AS THE EXPOSURE 700 FEET DOWNSTREAM. MOST LIKELY THE FAILURE SITE HAS ALWAYS BEEN COVERED BY WATER AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF SOIL.    WHEN THE FAILED SECTION WAS REPLACED TAPE COULD BE SEEN ON THE PIPE THROUGH THE ENTIRE EXCAVATION (ROUGHLY 90'). ALSO, IN LOOKING AT EXPOSED SECTIONS OF ORIGINAL LINE N PIPE, THE TAPE HAS BEEN PRESENT AT OTHER LOCATIONS AS WELL. TAPE WAS NOTED ON DOCUMENTATION FOR THE EXPOSURE MENTIONED ABOVE, AS WELL AS, SEEN ON A DIRECT ASSESSMENT DIG NEAR THE SHREVEPORT AREA. DUE TO THE ABOVE EXAMPLES THE TEAM BELIEVES THE TAPE IS PART OF ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION."

THE LINE WAS ISOLATED AND BLOWN DOWN.    TGP CONSULTED WITH A DIVE COMPANY TO SURVEY LINE 500-1. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT RIVER CONDITIONS PREVENTS THE DIVER FROM SAFELY REACHING AND ASSESSING THE LEAK. GIVEN THESE CONDITIONS ON 5/27/2020, TGP HIRED T BAKER SMITH (TBS) TO PERFORM A SONAR SURVEY TO MAP THE LEAK LOCATION. ON 6/15/2020, TGP RECEIVED THE FINAL REPORT FROM TBS. THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT SHOWED UNSUPPORTED PIPE EXPOSURE. THIS EXPOSURE COULD LIMIT THE RUNNING OF A ILI ASSESSMENT IN ITS CURRENT STATE AS NOTED IN SECTION E8. TGP IS ASSESSING THE DATA IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A PATH FORWARD.    THE LINE WILL REMAIN BLOWN DOWN AND ISOLATED UNTIL PERMANENT REPAIRS CAN BE MADE.

THE FACILITY IS LOCATED AT 69333 OMO ROAD, ARMADA, MICHIGAN (MACOMB COUNTY).    THE FIRE WAS INITIATED IN THE TURBINE EXHAUST CHAMBER DUE TO THE INTERACTION OF OIL AND HIGH TEMPERATURE GAS. THE PRESENCE OF OIL WAS DUE TO A MECHANICAL SEAL FAILURE IN THE TURBINE.THE MECHANICAL SEAL FAILURE RESULTED IN UNSTABLE TURBINE SPEED SENDING MULTIPLE ALARMS TO THE PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLER (PLC).     THE PLC FAILED TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS ONCE DATA POINTS REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 959 POINTS. THE PLC REGISTER FAULTED AND COULD NOT OVERWRITE THE DATA WHICH PREVENTED THE EQUIPMENT FROM SHUTTING DOWN PROPERLY. AS A RESULT OF THE PLC FAILURE, THE PROCESS GAS SUCTION, DISCHARGE AND FUEL GAS VALVES FAILED TO CLOSE.    A GASKET FAILURE OCCURRED BETWEEN THE TURBINE REACTION CHAMBER AND THE TURBINE RESULTING IN A FIRE IN THE INSULATION PROVIDING A HEAT SOURCE TO IGNITE THE GAS NEAR THE EXHAUST STACK.  THE FIRE WAS LIMITED TO THE 2-6 SKID AND EXHAUST STACK.  THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTED TO THE SITE ENTRANCE BUT WERE NOT UTILIZED TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.

THE FACILITY IS LOCATED AT 69333 OMO ROAD, ARMADA, MICHIGAN (MACOMB COUNTY).    STATION PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED AND ARRIVE ONSITE AT APPROXIMATELY 00:47 HOURS AND CONFIRMED HIGH GAS LEL IN THE PLANT 3 COMPRESSOR BUILDING.  STATION PERSONNEL THEN PROCEEDED TO DEPRESSURIZE UNIT 3-1 BY OPENING VALVES VGV-701 AND VGV-702.  THE GAS LEVEL WITHIN THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING GRADUALLY DECREASED TO ZERO.  IT WAS THEN CONFIRMED THAT UNIT 3-1 WAS THE CAUSE OF THE GAS LEAK.    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, THE STATION PERSONNEL HAVE WORKED THROUGH DISCOVERY ON THE UNIT BY DISASSEMBLING THROW #3 ON UNIT 3-1, AS WELL AS INSPECTING THE INTEGRITY OF THE OTHER THROWS.  AT THIS TIME THE DAMAGE IS ISOLATED TO THROW #3; HOWEVER, THE ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. COMPONENTS OF THROW #3 HAVE BEEN SENT TO CONSUMERS ENERGY'S LABORATORY FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS TO ASSIST WITH THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ROOT CAUSE OF FAILURE.     THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND LABORATORY ANALYSIS DETERMINED A SERIES OF FAILURES OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE RELEASE OF GAS WITH PROPERTY DAMAGE IN EXCESS OF $50,000. A MECHANICAL FAILURE ON UNIT 3-1 THROW 3 CAUSED BY LOSS OF TENSION OF THE CROSS HEAD BALANCE NUT WHICH ALLOWED THE PISTON AND ROD ASSEMBLY TO BACK OUT AND MAKE CONTACT WITH THE FIXED VOLUME CLEARANCE POCKET RESULTING IN FAILURE OF THE PISTON ROD. MAINTENANCE RECORDS FOR THE TORQUEING OF THE CROSS-HEAD BALANCE NUT WERE NOT AVAILABLE. THE EXCESSIVE VIBRATION THAT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE MECHANICAL FAILURE CAUSED THE BOLTS ON THE SUCTION VALVE UNLOADER TO LOOSEN AND GAS TO BE RELEASED.    THE SAFETY SYSTEM DESIGNED TO ISOLATE AND EVACUATED GAS THROUGH THE VENT VALVE DID NOT TRAVEL AUTOMATICALLY DURING THE EVENT AND INSTEAD REQUIRED MANUAL ACTIVATION.    PROBLEM SOLVING WAS COMPLETED FOR THE MECHANICAL AND SAFETY SYSTEM FAILURES AND ACTION ITEMS DEVELOPED TO MINIMIZE FUTURE RE-OCCURRENCE.  RESTORATION OF THE EQUIPMENT IS UNDERWAY, A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE NORMAL OPERATIONS IS RESUMED.    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION A COMPRESSOR RESTORATION PLAN WAS DEVELOPED FOR THROW #3.  THE PLAN INVOLVED REPLACING THE PISTON ROD, PISTON, THE CROSSHEAD, BALANCE NUT, INNER-CYLINDER HEAD AND THE FIXED VOLUME CLEARANCE POCKET. THE SUCTION VALVE UNLOADERS WERE DISASSEMBLED, INSPECTED AND REBUILT.     ACTIONS WERE ALSO TAKEN TO CORRECT THE VALVE POSITIONING ALLOWING THE SAFETY MECHANISM TO AUTOMATICALLY TRAVEL WHEN SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF GAS IS DETECTED IN THE BUILDING. FOLLOWING REMEDIATION NORMAL OPERATIONS WERE RESUMED ON DECEMBER 9, 2020."

AT THAT TIME, THE ESTIMATED QUANTITY GAS RELEASED WAS DETERMINED TO BE 39 MCF FROM THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION RECEIVED FROM THE PUBLIC BY GAS CONTROL AT 12:41 PM LOCAL TIME TO THE TIME OPERATION'S PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE.  AT THIS TIME, OPERATIONS BEGAN SERVICING THE VALVE TO STOP THE LEAK FROM THE ACTUATOR VENT.      AT 17:00 PM LOCAL TIME, NGPL OPERATIONS REPORTED THAT ATTEMPTS TO STOP THE LEAK WITH APPLICATION OF VALVE GREASE WAS NOT COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL AS THE LEAKING STOPPED BRIEFLY BUT CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY.  AT 17:10 PM LOCAL TIME, OPERATIONS DECIDES TO REMOVE THE VALVE FROM SERVICE AND ESTIMATES THE COST WOULD BE GREATER THAN $50,000.

THE 48-HOUR UPDATE COMMUNICATING NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WAS COMPLETED AT 16:25 PM LOCAL TIME ON 08/11/2020 (NRC REPORT NO. 1284327).    INVESTIGATION:  RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE VALVE X893E2, 20' PLUG VALVE INSTALLED IN 1957, PROVIDES CROSSOVER ISOLATION BETWEEN THE #2 AND #3 AMARILLO MAINLINES.  APPLICATION OF GREASE DOWN THE CENTER GREASE FITTING FORCES THE STEM PACKING AROUND THE VALVE STEM, SEALING IT, AND PREVENTING GAS FROM TRAVELING UP THE VALVE STEM AND EXITING THE ACTUATOR VENT. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OPERATIONS ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE LEAK FROM THE ACTUATOR VENT BY SERVICING THE VALVE WITH GREASE; HOWEVER, THIS ACTION DID NOT COMPLETELY STOP THE LEAK.  AT THAT TIME (APPROXIMATELY 17:10 PM LOCAL TIME), NGPL OPERATIONS DECIDED TO REMOVE THE VALVE AND ASSOCIATED CROSSOVER PIPING FROM SERVICE TO AVOID HAVING TO TAKE BOTH THE NGPL AMARILLO MAINLINES NO. 2 AND NO. 3 OUT OF SERVICE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING NATURAL GAS DELIVERIES TO CUSTOMERS DOWNSTREAM FROM THE LOCATION.       THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF HARD AND INEFFECTIVE STEM PACKING REMAINED IN THE PLUG ASSEMBLY.  THE IMMEDIATE/DIRECT CAUSE OF THE EVENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE STEM PACKING IN THE SERVICE LINE WAS DEPLETED AND NO LONGER SERVICEABLE.  THE BASIC/ROOT CAUSES INCLUDED THE AGE AND SERVICEABILITY OF THE STEM PACKING.    CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  REVIEW VALVE SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES WITH ALL NGPL OPERATORS INVOLVED IN VALVE SERVICING/MAINTENANCE FOR THESE TYPES OF VALVES TO LIMIT VALVE-PACKING LEAKAGE GOING FORWARD.

GREGORY CORNETT,DIRECTOR LEGAL SERVICES-ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL,502-627-2756,greg.cornett@lge-ku.com,"ON AUGUST 6, 2020 A GAS STORAGE WELL CASING FAILURE OCCURRED AT THE A.H. PERKINS 5 (PERKINS #5) GAS STORAGE WELL IN HARRISON COUNTY NEAR LACONIA, INDIANA, RESULTING IN A UNCONTROLLED NATURAL GAS RELEASE. AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE, A COMPANY CONTRACTOR CREW WAS INSTALLING AN UNDERGROUND PIPELINE DRIP.  THE WELL CASING FAILURE OCCURRED AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABOVE GROUND CASING COLLAR. THE FAILURE DID NOT CAUSE ANY INJURIES OR SIGNIFICANT THIRD-PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE. NO IGNITION OF GAS OR LIQUIDS OCCURRED DURING THIS EVENT. LG&E IMPLEMENTED ITS EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND THE WELL WAS SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED AND CAPPED ON AUGUST 11, 2020.     DNV GL, A GLOBAL QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT COMPANY, WAS RETAINED TO INVESTIGATE THE WELL CASING FAILURE BY CONDUCTING A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AND FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE LIKELY METALLURGICAL CAUSE(S) AND IDENTIFY ANY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.  A CROSS-FUNCTIONAL INTERNAL TEAM WAS FORMED TO PERFORM AN INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. THE TEAM REVIEWED  GAS STORAGE WELL DOCUMENTATION, DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH PIPELINE DRIP REPLACEMENT, DNVGL METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT AND THE POST INCIDENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE DOCUMENTATION.   THE TEAM ALSO  CONDUCTED WITNESS INTERVIEWS AND PERFORMED A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION TOOK PLACE DURING THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC WHICH LIMITED SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND REQUIRED STRICT PROTOCOLS FOR ANY IN PERSON MEETINGS, INTERVIEWS, AND COLLABORATIONS.      THE  INVESTIGATION ULTIMATELY CONCLUDED THE PRIMARY FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE FAILURE OF PERKINS #5 WAS INADEQUATE OPERATIONAL CONTROLS.  SPECIFICALLY, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WERE UNDERTAKEN WHILE FIELD PIPING WAS CONNECTED TO THE GAS STORAGE WELLHEAD RESULTING IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD STRESSES ON WELL CASING FROM EXTERNAL FORCES LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE PIPELINE DRIP.      THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT BY DNV GL STATED ""THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS  INDICTED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF DUCTILE OVERLOAD FROM A SIGNIFICANT EXTERNAL BENDING OR LONGITUDINAL FORCE, LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH EXCAVATION, AND INSTALLATION OF THE DRIP PIPING"".      THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION FOUND THESE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCIDENT INCLUDED:     A. CONNECTION OF FIELD PIPELINE TO THE WELLHEAD WHILE UNDER CONSTRUCTION RESULTED IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD AND FAILURE OF THE WELL CASING PIPE.    B. PIPELINE DESIGN DRAWINGS WERE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES THAT PROHIBITED CONNECTION OF FIELD PIPELINE TO THE WELLHEAD WHILE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  C. FIELD PIPELINE DRIP WAS NOT PREFABRICATED IN CONFORMANCE WITH DESIGN DRAWING.  D. DESIGN DRAWINGS DID NOT INCLUDE DETAILED NOTES OR REFERENCES.      D3 - COMPONENT THAT FAILED IS GAS STORAGE WELL CASING, SO PIR DOESN'T APPLY. USED DEFAULT VALUE OF ""1"".  PIR IS NOT APPLICABLE TO STORAGE WELL.    E2 - 3 BECAUSE THE FIELD REQUIRED A NUMERICAL VALUE WE USED THE PIPELINE SYSTEM MAOP.  HOWEVER, THE WELL CASING THAT FAILED DOES NOT FALL UNDER 192.619 OR 192.620.    E9 - THERE IS NOT A CHOICE FOR RESERVOIR GAS STORAGE WELL.  WE CHOSE THE CLOSEST AVAILABLE OPTION.    E11 - THE STORAGE FIELD INJECTION RATE AND INJECTION PRESSURE ARE MONITORED BY GAS CONTROL BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WELLS ARE NOT MONITORED.     G7.5 - OQ RELATED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE FIELD PIPELINE COMPONENTS RESULTED IN STRESSES IMPOSED ON STORAGE WELL CASING RESULTING IN FAILURE."

THE RELEASE WAS CAUSED WHEN THE STATION FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM RECEIVED AN INDICATION OF A FLAME AND INITIATED THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) SYSTEM.  WHEN THE ESD WAS INITIATED, THE GAS CONTROLLER RECEIVED A SCADA ALARM AND DISPATCHED A TECHNICIAN TO THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE.    WHEN THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT THE SITE, NATURAL GAS WAS DISCOVERED BEING RELEASED THROUGH THE STATION BLOWDOWN.  IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS TAKEN TO STOP THE RELEASE BY CLOSING BLOWDOWN VALVE AND SECURING THE SITE.  SINCE THE INCIDENT, EUNICE COMPRESSOR STATION HAS REMAINED STAFFED 24-HOURS A DAY UNTIL REPAIRS CAN BE COMPLETED ON THE ISOLATION VALVE.    INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT HAS INDICATED THAT THE ACTIVATION OF THE ESD SYSTEM AND FAILURE OF THE ISOLATION VALVE TO COMPLETELY OPERATE CONTRIBUTED TO THE GAS LOSS.   NO EVIDENCE OF FLAME OR FIRE WERE OBSERVED IN THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT THAT WOULD INITIATE THE ESD.   ADDITIONALLY, AN AUTOMATIC ISOLATION VALVE FAILED TO COMPLETELY CLOSE RESULTING IN THE CONTINUING RELEASE OF GAS TO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH THE STATION'S BLOWDOWN STACK.   INVESTIGATION HAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT THREE-WAY PILOT GAS VALVES AND END-OF-TRAVEL STOP VALVES ASSOCIATED WITH AUTOMATIC OPERATION CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCOMPLETE CLOSURE OF THE ISOLATION VALVE DUE TO AN INSUFFICIENT GAS SUPPLY.   FIVE VALVES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE INVESTIGATION THAT REQUIRED REPAIR AND THE REPLACEMENT OF PILOT VALVES.    ON 1 MARCH 2021, REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT WAS COMPLETED ON THREE ESD VALVES IDENTIFIED DURING THE INVESTIGATION.  ON APRIL 21, 2021, THE TWO REMAINING VALVES WERE REPAIRED.  FOLLOWING THE VALVE REPAIR, A SUCCESSFUL EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM TEST WAS COMPLETED.  FOLLOWING THE ESD TEST, THE STATION WAS RETURNED TO UNMANNED OPERATION CAPABILITY."

AT APPROXIMATELY 2:10 PM MT, OPERATIONS STARTED UNIT #2 AT THE ROBERSON CREEK COMPRESSOR STATION TO CHECK THE OPERATION OF THE VFD.  AFTER OPERATING THE UNIT FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES THE UNIT WAS SHUT DOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 2:20 PM MT BY LOCAL OPERATIONS. EACH TIME A UNIT SHUTS DOWN, A TWO HOUR TIMER STARTS TO BLOWDOWN THE COMPRESSOR CASE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00 PM MT, KM PERSONNEL LEFT FOR THE DAY. AT 4:26 PM MT, THE UNIT VENT VALVE OPENED TO VENT THE COMPRESSOR CASE. NORMALLY IN THIS SITUATION, THE UNIT DISCHARGE VALVE WOULD BE IN THE CLOSED POSITION; HOWEVER, THE DISCHARGE VALVE WAS IN THE OPEN POSITION. THIS ALLOWED GAS TO CONTINUE TO VENT FROM THE STATION DISCHARGE. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2020, AT APPROXIMATELY 6:50 AM MT, STATION PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE FACILITY, HEARD THE GAS BLOWING AND CLOSED THE VENT VALVE THAT THEY FOUND IN THE OPEN POSITION. GAS LOSS WAS CALCULATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 150 MMCF.     THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE UNIT DISCHARGE VALVE WAS COMMANDED OPEN BY THE UNIT PLC AT 2:25PM.  IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED WHY THE VALVE WAS COMMANDED OPEN OR WHERE THE COMMAND CAME FROM. THE INVESTIGATION TEAM WAS UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION AND SUSPECTS THAT THE PLC EXPERIENCED A MALFUNCTION THAT CAUSED IT TO SEND THE UNINTENDED SIGNAL TO OPEN. THE INVESTIGATION ALSO REVEALED THAT THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE PLC PROGRAMMING. THERE WAS A LOGIC PATH THAT ALLOWED THE CONFIRMATION OF THE UNIT VALVE CLOSURES TO BE BYPASSED WHEN BLOWING DOWN THE COMPRESSOR UNIT. IN ORDER TO PREVENT A REOCCURRENCE, THE PLC LOGIC WAS MODIFIED TO ENSURE THAT THE UNIT SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES ARE CLOSED BEFORE THE UNIT VENT VALVE IS OPENED. ADDITIONALLY, CIG ASSESSED THE PLC LOGIC OF THE OTHER TWO COMPRESSOR UNITS AND MADE CHANGES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, A CALLOUT ALARM WAS ADDED IN THE EVENT THAT UNIT VENT VALVE IS OPEN AT THE SAME TIME AS A UNIT SUCTION OR DISCHARGE VALVE. FINALLY, A VENT STACK FLOW SWITCH WAS INSTALLED TO HELP DETECT ANY FUTURE UNINTENDED RELEASES."

THESE TWO VALVE CLOSURES ISOLATE THE KEYSTONE CS SUCTION PIPING.  - AT 10:01AM, KEYSTORE STARTED INJECTION  - GAS CONTROL CALLED PERMIAN PRODUCERS ASKING THEM TO SHUT IN EARLY  - AT 10:27AM, THE EPNG OPERATIONS SPECIALIST WAS SENT TO LINE 3026 TO CLOSE VALVE 3.   - AT 10:14AM, A SECOND EPNG OPERATIONS SPECIALIST OPENED LINE 1115 TO ALLOW GAS TO FLOW NORTH TO PLAINS.  BY 11:25AM, ALL OF THE RELIEF VALVES HAD RESEATED AND PRESSURES RETURNED TO BELOW MAOP BY 12:16PM.  THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS A FAILURE OF CLEAR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EPNG OPERATIONS AND THE CONTROL CENTER.

PLEASE REFER TO THAT INCIDENT REPORT FOR THE INITIAL NARRATIVE.      THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN CHANGED IN PART G FROM EXTERNAL CORROSION TO INTERNAL CORROSION.  THIS CHANGE HAS OCCURRED BECAUSE OF DATA THAT WAS GATHERED FROM RUNNING A HIGH RESOLUTION VERTALOG, WHICH CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CORROSION.  THE INTERNAL CORROSION WAS ALSO VERIFIED WITH A CALIPER LOG THAT WAS RUN DOWN THE CASING WITH THE VERTALOG TOOL.      AS NOTED IN THE INITIAL REPORT, THE WELL WAS KILLED AND THEN A COMPOSITE PLUG WAS PLACED AT 4479' JUST ABOVE THE PERFORATIONS.  A PRODUCTION CASING WAS INSTALLED FROM SURFACE TO 4431'.  THE PRODUCTION CASING WAS CEMENTED IN PLACE.  CEMENT WAS RUN DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE INNER CASING AND THERE WERE RETURNS TO SURFACE THROUGH THE ANNULAR SPACE BETWEEN THE NEW PRODUCTION CASING AND THE OUTER CASING.  THIS SEALED THE LEAK IN THE OUTER CASING AND PROVIDES A MITIGATION AGAINST ADDITIONAL LEAKS.  A CEMENT BOND LOG WAS RUN FOR THE CEMENTING WORK OF THE INNER CASING AND NO DEFICIENCIES WERE NOTED IN THE LOG.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS COMPLETED ON THE NEW INSTALLATION AND NO ISSUES WERE NOTED DURING THE TEST.  FOLLOWING THE INTEGRITY TESTING, THE COMPOSITE PLUG WAS DRILLED OUT.  THE WELL WAS THEN RE-COMMISSIONED ON 12/01/20.  THE WELL HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR TWO WEEKS WITH NO IDENTIFIED ISSUES.  AS AN ADDITIONAL MITIGATION, LEAK SURVEYS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AROUND THE WELL AND ALONG THE PREVIOUS INCIDENT PLUME BOUNDARY.      THE PLUME FROM THE INCIDENT HAS DISSIPATED SIGNIFICANTLY.  READINGS WITHIN THE PLUME AREA ARE UNDER A PERCENT GAS IN BAR HOLES.  NWE IS CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE PLUME AND WILL DO SO UNTIL IT HAS DISSIPATED.  THERE ARE NO SAFETY OR PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS.    THIS WILL BE THE FINAL REPORT FOR THIS INCIDENT."

HIGH-RES MFL TOOL RUNS WERE CONDUCTED, AND A PRELIMINARY REPORT WAS PROVIDED TO WILLIAMS WITH ANOMALIES ON THE WEEK OF 5/25/2020.  WILLIAMS INITIATED PROJECTS TO ADDRESS ANOMALIES IN ORDER OF PRIORITY. THIS PARTICULAR DIG DID NOT MEET THE SAME CRITERIA AS OTHER'S IN THE AREA - UNDER CALLED BY THE TOOL. AS A RESULT THIS PIN HOLE WAS NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL REMEDIATION OF OTHER LEAKS IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA HAD BEEN COMPLETED. SIMILAR TO OTHER ANOMALIES IN THE AREA EXCAVATION UNCOVERED A PIN-HOLE LEAK RESULTING FROM CORROSION. LEAK SURVEYS PRIOR TO FEATURE ASSESSMENT DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNS OF LEAKING. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED AERIAL LEAK SURVEY 9/22/2020, AND GROUND SURVEY 9/23/2020. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF FOUL ODORS OR DISCOLORED VEGETATION PRIOR TO DIGGING. THE FIRST INDICATION OF GAS OCCURRED AFTER THE FEATURE WAS UNCOVERED. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE FEATURE LEAKED FROM THE FIRST INDICATION OF GAS FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS BEFORE THE LINE WAS SHUT IN AND BLOWN DOWN FROM AN OPERATING PRESSURE OF ABOUT 600PSIG TO 14PSIG. AFTER ASSESSING REPAIR OPTIONS WILLIAMS PROJECT MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT REPAIRS WOULD BE BEST ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH PIPE REPLACEMENT. THE PRELIMINARY COST OF REPAIRS EXCEEDS $50,000, WITH COST OF CONTRACTOR AND INTERNAL LABOR APPROACHING $200,000. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS QUALIFIED AS A DOT REPORT-ABLE INCIDENT BASED ON COST WHEN WILLIAMS MANAGEMENT SETTLED ON PIPE REPLACEMENT AS THE PREFERRED REPAIR OPTION ON 9/24/2020.

WHILE NO DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE WAS DETERMINED, USING THE GEOLOGICAL, METEOROLOGICAL, SITE-GATHERED DATA AND HISTORICAL DATA, KINDER MORGAN TEXAS PIPELINE (KMTP) CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE COMPUTER MODELING AND IDENTIFIED EARTH MOVEMENT OF THE SOIL SURROUNDING THE PIPE AS THE MOST PLAUSIBLE CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE OF CIRCUMFERENTIAL SCC WAS NOT OBSERVED IN THE ILI DATA REVIEW OR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON THE AVAILABLE PIPE, IT CANNOT BE DEFINITIVELY RULED OUT AS A PLAUSIBLE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR OR CAUSE OF THE FAILURE.     THE REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT TEAM HAS DETERMINED THAT THE REPAIR OF THE KMTP INDEX 85 PIPE BY THE HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING METHOD (HDD) SHOULD PREVENT A REOCCURRENCE OF THE FAILURE DUE TO POTENTIAL EARTH MOVEMENT.

AT 9:33 PM, COMPANY MONITORING CENTER PERSONNEL RECEIVED A CALL FROM GAS CONTROL REGARDING A PRESSURE DROP. THE PRESSURE HAD DROPPED FROM 1,190 TO 1,156 PSIG, FOLLOWED BY A SUBSEQUENT DROP TO 1,035 PSIG AFTER SHUTTING-IN PRESSURE REGULATION. AT 9:35 PM, FIELD PERSONNEL WERE CONTACTED BY A NEAR-BY PROPERTY OWNER REPORTING THE SOUND OF A GAS LINE LEAK; SUBSEQUENTLY, COMPANY OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED TO RESPOND TO THE EVENT LOCATION.    FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 9:45 PM AND OBSERVED GAS BLOWING; THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT CLOSED CUNNINGHAM ROAD AT THIS TIME. AT 9:54 PM A COMPANY SF TECHNICIAN CONFIRMED THAT THE REPORTED LEAK HAD BEEN ISOLATED BY OPERATING THE CRITICAL VALVE. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AND PHMSA ACCIDENT INCIDENT DIVISION WERE CONTACTED WITHIN 1 HOUR OF CONFIRMED DISCOVERY AT 10:50 PM. NRC ONE-HOUR (1291972) AND 48-HR (1292099) REPORTS WERE COMPLETED ON NOVEMBER 11TH AND NOVEMBER 13TH RESPECTIVELY. THE FAILED STORAGE LINE (9190) WAS SECURED AND SENT TO A METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS LABORATORY TO EVALUATE AND DETERMINE THE PROBABLE CAUSE BEHIND THIS PIPELINE FAILURE.     THE REPAIR OF THE LINE CONSISTED OF PIPE REPLACEMENT. THE METALLURGICAL ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION IDENTIFIED ALONG THE 6:00 O'CLOCK ORIENTATION OF THE PIPE. THE ABSENCE OF AN EXTERNAL COATING AND EXPOSURE TO ATMOSPHERE (I.E. DE-COUPLED FROM THE SOIL ELECTROLYTE) WERE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE CORROSION OF THE PIPE.    IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT FUTURE OCCURRENCE, THE COMPANY HAS LOOKED BEYOND THIS LOCATION TO OTHER SEGMENTS WITH SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND PIPE CHARACTERISTICS WHERE CORROSION MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT LINE INTEGRITY; TO THAT END, TWO OPPORTUNITIES FOR MITIGATIVE MEASURES HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 2022. THE PROJECTS WILL INVOLVE REPLACING LINE SEGMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF THE REMOVED SEGMENTS FOR EXTERNAL CORROSION.    NOTE: ALL TIMES WERE RECORDED IN EASTERN STANDARD TIME"

A STATION MECHANIC AT THE SITE WAS NOTIFIED AND CONFIRMED ACTIVATION OF THE PLANT FIREGATE SYSTEM OCCURRED  DUE TO THE FIRE DETECTION ALARM.  FOLLOWING THE EVENT, THE PLANT WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE AND THE SCENE WAS MADE SAFE. ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE STATION TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THE ACTIVATION.    DURING THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION, SCORCH MARKS WERE DISCOVERED ON INSULATION ON THE REBOILER VENT STACK. THE PLANT SAFETY SYSTEM IDENTIFIED A HIGH HEAT SIGNATURE ON THE THERMAL OXIDIZER WHICH INITIATED THE FIREGATE ACTIVATION. THE EQUIPMENT WAS TAKEN OFF-LINE AND PHYSICALLY INSPECTED. SEVERAL CRACKED WELDS WERE IDENTIFIED ON THE EXHAUST LINE OF THE THERMAL OXIDIZER.    THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION ON DECEMBER 5, 2020 BECAUSE THE EMERGENCY SHUT-DOWN SYSTEM WAS ACTIVATED, AND GAS RELEASED.  HOWEVER, A MORE IN-DEPTH VISUAL INSPECTION CONFIRMED ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT DAMAGE ANTICIPATED TO EXCEED PHMSA REPORTING CRITERIA OF $50,000.  ONCE THIS WAS DISCOVERED, ON DECEMBER 10, 2020 A NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.     ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION SUBSEQUENT TO THE EVENT HAS IDENTIFIED A CONCERN RELATIVE TO DESIGN/ACTUAL UNIT OPERATING TEMPERATURE, MATERIAL TEMPERATURE LIMITS OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM COMPONENTS, AND EXCESSIVE THERMAL CYCLING CAUSED BY SYSTEM PROGRAMMING. FURTHER PROBLEM SOLVING IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. HOWEVER WITH THE CONCERNS DEFINED, CONSUMERS ENERGY HAS TAKEN ACTION TO REMEDIATE EACH CONCERN THROUGH A DECREASE IN THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF THE SYSTEM AND A REDUCTION IN THERMAL CYCLING OF THE EQUIPMENT. ALL DAMAGED MATERIALS HAVE BEEN REPLACED AND WELDS HAVE BEEN IMPROVED IN THE RESTORATION PROCESS.    FURTHER ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE SYSTEM DESIGN AND MATERIAL SUPPLY OF THE THERMAL OXIDIZER SUPERHEATER TO THE EXHAUST STACK INADEQUATELY ACCOUNTED FOR THE STRESS LEVELS PRESENT ON THE SYSTEM DUE TO THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE RANGE OF THE SYSTEM.    IN ADDITION TO THE INITIAL REMEDIAL ACTIONS TAKEN, THE EQUIPMENT WAS ANALYZED TO DETERMINE FATIGUE AND STRESS. THE EVALUATION RESULTED IN EQUIPMENT DESIGN MODIFICATIONS TO (1) REDUCE THE STRESS PRESENT IN THE SYSTEM AND (2) PROVIDE ACCESS FOR INSPECTIONS AND REPAIRS.  ADDITIONALLY, THERMAL CYCLES WILL BE MONITORED AND INSPECTED AT A PREDETERMINED CYCLE COUNT TO CONFIRM SYSTEM INTEGRITY."

THE FAILURE WAS AT AN ORIGINAL ACETYLENE GIRTH WELD COMPLETED IN 1947. THE FAILED SECTION WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A LAB FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED ON 12/18/2020 (NRC # 1294597). A 48 HR FOLLOW UP CALL WAS PROVIDED TO THE NRC ON  12/20/2020 (NRC # 1294630).   AT TIME OF REPORT SUBMISSION, ENABLE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS HAS NOT YET RECEIVED THE RESULTS OF THE LAB ANALYSIS. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE REPORT IS COMPLETED.    03.15.2021 UPDATE    ON DECEMBER 18TH, 2020 AT 15:22 ENABLE GAS TRANSMISSION SYSTEM CONTROL DETECTED LOSS OF PRESSURE VIA SCADA FOR LINE A-SOUTH IN CADDO PARISH LOUISIANA. LOCAL OPERATIONS WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO LOCATE THE FAILURE. ENABLE RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDER AT 16:02 NOTIFYING THEM OF THE EXACT FAILURE LOCATION. THE FAILURE WAS FOUND BY LOCAL PUBLIC WHO NOTIFIED THE LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDER. ENABLE OPERATIONS WERE ONSITE AT 16:40.   THE FAILED SECTION WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A LAB FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE LAB RESULTS PERFORMED ON THE SUBMITTED FRACTURED GIRTH WELD INDICATE THAT THE CAUSE OF FAILURE IS RELATED TO A TENSILE LOAD ACTING ON THE GIRTH WELD THAT HAD HOT CRACKING PRESENT IN THE ROOT AND CAP WELD METAL.   THE INITIATION OF THE FRACTURE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE GIRTH WELD DUE TO THE REDUCED EFFECTIVE WALL THICKNESS IN THE GIRTH WELD METAL CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF HOT CRACKING AND STRESS RISERS CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF HOT CRACKING.  THE TENSILE LOAD IS PRESUMED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTRUCTION THAT OCCURRED ON A-SOUTH IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FAILED GIRTH WELD IN JUNE OF 2020. THE JUNE 2020 JOB CONSISTED OF INSTALLING 88 FEET OF PIPE TO REMEDIATE DRESSER COUPLES (DC) ON THE LINE. TO HELP STABILIZE THE LEGACY PIPE, 3 SLEEVES WERE INSTALLED UPSTREAM AND 3 SLEEVES WERE INSTALLED DOWNSTREAM ON ACETYLENE GIRTH WELDS (AGW) AND DC PRIOR TO THE NEW CONSTRUCTION. THE FAILURE LOCATION WAS A MISSED GIRTH WELD (FIRST ACETYLENE WELD DOWNSTREAM OF REPLACEMENT) WHICH WAS NOT IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO AND DURING CONSTRUCTION.    TO INCREASE PIPE STABILITY THE STANDARD PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO INSTALL SLEEVES WHEN AGW ARE EXPOSED AND PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION. THE 88-FOOT REPLACEMENT WAS PERFORMED IN JUNE 2020. THE SLEEVES WERE INSTALLED IN FEBRUARY OF 2020 IN ADVANCE OF THE PIPE REPLACEMENT PROJECT. THE PROCESS TO EXPOSE A GIRTH WELD IS TO REMOVE AS LITTLE DIRT AS POSSIBLE (TO LIMIT STRESS ON PIPE WHILE PRESSURIZED) UNTIL A AGW IS DISCOVERED AND A SLEEVE CAN BE INSTALLED. GOING FORWARD, ENABLE WILL UPDATE THEIR DC AND AGW PROCEDURES TO INCLUDE THE PRACTICE OF REMOVING ALL DIRT (WHILE THE PIPELINE SEGMENT IS FULLY EVACUATED) FROM THE LEGACY PIPE CUTOUT TO THE FIRST GIRTH WELD UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM. THIS WILL ENSURE THE FIRST JOINT HAS NOT BEEN MISSED AND HAS THE REQUIRED INSTALLED SLEEVE PRIOR TO THE PIPE BEING RE-PRESSURIZED.    03.15.2021 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT  C.3E CHANGED TO SEAMLESS  D.7D ADDED $27,000  G.2 ADDED HOT CRACKING  H.

FLOW WENT FROM A RANGE OF 1800-8500MCFD JUMPING TO 10500MCFD BETWEEN SCANS. LOCAL OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE INITIALLY CONTACTED AT 11:35PM (LOCAL TIME). WILLIAMS CONTACTED NORTHWEST NATURAL AT 11:45PM LOCAL TIME, AND THEY REPORTED SEEING ABNORMAL FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL. SOON AFTERWARDS A NORTHWEST NATURAL REPRESENTATIVE CALLED BACK TO REPORT THAT A CAR HAD CRASHED INTO THE METER STATION AND THAT THE KLIKITAT FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CLOSING THE HOOD RIVER BRIDGE AT HWY 14. AT 12:08PM KLICKITAT EMERGENCY DISPATCH CALLED TO LET US KNOW ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND ALSO REPORTED A STRONG ODOR OF GAS AND LOUD NOISE. AT 12:17PM THE LOCAL DISTRICT MANAGER WAS INFORMED OF THE SITUATION, AND ADDITIONAL LOCAL PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED. AT 12:36PM THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO WILLIAMS SAFETY OPERATIONS CENTER. AT ABOUT 1:00AM TECHNICIANS FROM NORTHWEST NATURAL AND WILLIAMS ARRIVED ON SITE. AT 1:35AM IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LATERAL FEEDING THE STATION WOULD NEED TO BE COMPLETELY SHUT-IN TO ISOLATE THE INCIDENT. AT 2:20AM VALVES 75-0 AND 75-0X WERE CLOSED TO ISOLATE THE LATERAL, AND BY 3:15AM THE FLOW AND PRESSURE REACHED 0. BY 2PM THAT DAY THE STATION WAS ISOLATED AT ITS TAP VALVE, AND THE LATERAL WAS RE-PACKED IN ANTICIPATION OF A MOBILE METER STATION, AND REPAIRS/RETURN TO SERVICE OF THE PERMANENT FACILITY.     CASE SUMMARY FROM DEPUTY REPORT FOR INCIDENT 20-B1728:  ""ON 12/20/2020, AT ABOUT 2330 HOURS, I WAS DISPATCHED TO AN MVC INVOLVING UNKNOWN INJURIES NEAR BRIDGEMART ON HWY 14. ON ARRIVAL AT THE COLLISION SCENE, I OBSERVED A VEHICLE THAT APPEARED TO HAVE COLLIDED WITH A GAS PLANT LOCATED ON THE NORTH SIDE AT THE INTERSECTION OF HWY 14 AND THE HOOD RIVER BRIDGE. I ATTEMPTED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE VEHICLE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DUE TO MULTIPLE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS, EMS, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARRIVED TO ASSIST WITH VARIOUS TASKS. NW NATURAL, OWNER OF THE GAS PLANT, SENT CREWS TO SHUT OFF LINES THAT WERE DAMAGED AND RELEASING GAS INTO THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE. THIS CREATED A HAZARDOUS RISK FOR ANYONE WITHIN .5 MILES OF THE COLLISION SCENE. THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE, BENJAMIN SOLORIO, WAS ABLE TO SELF EXTRICATE AND MAKE CONTACT WITH A WASHINGTON STATE PATROL TROOPER. SOLORIO WAS EVALUATED BY EMS AND TAKEN TO SKYLINE HOSPITAL ER, WHERE HE WAS TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES. IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE WSP TROOPER THAT SOLORIO WAS DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL DURING THE TIME OF THE COLLISION AND AT AN EXCESS SPEED OF AT LEAST TWICE THAT OF THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT, 25 MPH OR MORE, ON THE HOOD RIVER BRIDGE AND THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AT HWY 14. ALL AGENCIES INVOLVED TOOK APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS, AND THE COLLISION SCENE WAS HANDLED PER STANDARD PROTOCOLS. THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY OF HOOD RIVER, OR. WAS GREATLY AFFECTED BY THIS INCIDENT. MANY WERE... LEFT WITHOUT NATURAL GAS FOR HEATING, COOKING, ETC. SOLORIO WAS PROCESSED FOR DUI THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT AND CITED FOR RECKLESS DRIVING ON 12/27/2020""    ADDITIONAL DETAIL FROM POLICE REPORT:  ""BRIDGEMART WAS CLOSED AND THE STORE EMPLOYEE WAS ADVISED TO EVACUATE. THE RESIDENTS STAYING AT THE RV PARK WERE ALSO ADVISED TO STAY CLEAR OF THE INCIDENT AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE. RESIDENCES NORTH OF THE COLLISION, INCLUDING SE OAK ST FROM SE 1ST TO SE 7TH ST, WERE ADVISED TO SHELTER IN PLACE BY CLOSING ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS. DISPATCH ASSISTED BY USING A REVERSE 911 SYSTEM TO ADVISE AND FIRE UNITS ALSO WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR TO RESIDENCES.""

INITIAL OBSERVATIONS BY THE FIELD INVESTIGATION TEAM INDICATED THE FAILURE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY PREVIOUS THIRD PARTY DAMAGE. THE FIELD INVESTIGATION TEAM IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF GOUGES AND SCORES ACROSS A SEGMENT OF PIPE WHICH WAS FOUND ABOUT 100 YARDS SOUTH OF THE FAILURE SITE. THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS EVENT ARE A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR COMMENCING EXCAVATION PRIOR TO THE CLEARING OF A ONE CALL TICKET. THERE WERE TWO ONE CALL TICKETS REGARDING THIS PROPERTY. ONE FOR OCT 30 TO CLEAR TREES AND REMOVE TERRACES AND ONE FROM DEC 4 TO BURY LEFT OVER DEBRIS FROM A BURN PILE. THE DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE PROBABLY OCCURRED AT THE OCT 30 WORK.  A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS A FIELD OPERATIONS FAILURE TO FOLLOW NORTHERN PROCEDURE BY GIVING VERBAL APPROVAL FOR EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES IN PROXIMITY TO A PIPELINE BEGIN BEFORE THE EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON SITE. BOTH TIMES THE ONE CALL TICKETS WERE COMPLETED BY THE SAME EMPLOYEE AND THE PIPELINES MARKED IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMPANY PROCEDURES. THE EMPLOYEE REMAINED ON SITE UNTIL ALL WORK WAS COMPLETED.

AT 05:19-HOURS, GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A SCADA ALARM.  THE CONTROLLER ON DUTY, USING THE CALL-OUT SYSTEM, NOTIFIED THE PROPER OPERATIONS PERSONNEL AT THAT TIME.      AT 06:04-HOURS, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT ELLERSLIE COMPRESSOR STATION AND CONFIRMED NATURAL GAS WAS VENTING.  UPON SAFELY ENTERING THE COMPRESSOR STATION PROPERTY, THE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL BEGAN INSPECTING THE COMPRESSOR STATION TO DETERMINE WHY NATURAL GAS WAS STILL VENTING FOLLOWING THE ESD FUNCTION.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL FOUND VALVE #19 WHICH IS PART OF THE ESD SYSTEM LOCATED IN THE SUCTION SIDE OF THE STATION PIPING, HAD NOT FULLY CLOSED.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED VALVE #19 AND THE STATION WAS SHUT DOWN AT 6:30-HOURS.  FIELD OPERATIONS INITIATED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE (ERL) PROCESS FOLLOWING INTERNAL PROCEDURES AND THE INCIDENT WAS DEEMED REPORTABLE DURING THE ERL CALL.     AS PART OF SNG'S POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION PROCESS THE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ON SITE DISCOVERED AN EXIT POINT IN THE COMPRESSOR STATION YARD WITH SOME ICE FORMED NEAR AN UNDERGROUND ESD FACILITY PIPE.  SNG STARTED THE EXCAVATION PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE UNDERGROUND LEAK.  AFTER EXPOSING THE UNDERGROUND ESD PIPE, SNG DISCOVERED THAT THE 1/2-INCH ESD PIPE HAD A CRACK IN A THREADED CONNECTION.     DURING THE ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CRACKED UNDERGROUND ESD PIPE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ESD EVENT.  FURTHERMORE, THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT VALVE #19 DID NOT FULLY CLOSE AS DESIGNED ALLOWING THE VOLUME OF GAS RELEASED TO BE ABOVE THE PHMSA REPORTABLE THRESHOLD.     OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT EXPEDITED A CONTRACTOR TO COME ON SITE AND REPAIR THE BURIED 1/2-INCH ESD LINE.  THE CRACKED PIPE WAS SENT TO A LAB FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND THE LINE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 26, 2020.      OPERATIONS PERSONNEL CHECKED AND CYCLED VALVE #19 WITH NO ISSUE.  VALVE #19 IS CLOSED AND LOCKED OUT OF SERVICE.  SNG OPERATIONS HAS ORDERED A NEW SHAFER OPERATOR FOR 2021 INSTALLATION.       WITH GENERAL SAFETY INSPECTION OF THE COMPRESSOR STATION AND COORDINATION WITH GAS CONTROL, THE COMPRESSOR STATION RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 22:15-HOURS, DECEMBER 26, 2020.    THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE 1/2-INCH ESD LINE PIPE SPECIMEN DETERMINED THE CRACK OCCURRED BECAUSE OF HIGH CYCLE, LOW NOMINAL STRESS BENDING FATIGUE INITIATING IN THE ROOT OF THE THREADS.  THE ANALYSIS ALSO NOTED THE STEEL PIPE CHEMISTRY DID NOT MEET ASTM A53 GRADE B STANDARDS DUE TO HIGHER PHOSPHORUS CONTENT.  HOWEVER, TESTING FOUND THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE STEEL MEETS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF ASTM A53 GRADE B.  THE 1/2-INCH ESD LINE WAS PROMPTLY REPAIRED TO RETURN THE STATION TO SERVICE."

THE CALLER INFORMED THE TGP EMPLOYEE OF A POTENTIAL INCIDENT WITH ONE OF THE TGP PIPELINES LOCATED IN MARSHALL COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI.  THE EMPLOYEE IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR WHO IN TURN CALLED THE AREA MANAGER.  THE AREA MANAGER DIRECTED THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR TO BEGIN CALLING AND MOBILIZING PERSONNEL TOWARDS THE HOLLY SPRINGS AREA.  THE AREA MANAGER THEN CONTACTED TGP'S GAS CONTROL STAFF TO ASCERTAIN IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY PRESSURE CHANGES AND THEY HAD NOT.  THE AREA MANAGER THEN CALLED THE HOLLY SPRINGS GAS DEPARTMENT WHO DIRECTED HIM TO THE MARSHALL COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (EMA) STAFF.  AT 16:56-HOUR, THE AREA MANAGER CONTACTED THE EMA FOR ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE EMA PERSONNEL HAD BLOCKED JACK THOMPSON ROAD AFTER EVACUATING SOME RESIDENCES IN THE AREA.  TGP DIVISION STAFF AND THE LOCAL AREA MANGER INITIATED AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE CONFERENCE CALL TO DISCUSS THE PENDING SITUATION AND ACTIONS CURRENTLY TAKEN.  OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, TGP DECIDED TO CALL THE NRC AND REPORT THE POTENTIAL INCIDENT SITUATION.  AT 18:25, A TGP FIELD EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT MLV #68 TO INSTALL A MANUAL PRESSURE GAUGE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ANY PRESSURE ISSUES ON THE TGP LINE 100-1.  SUBSEQUENTLY, AT 18:37, ANOTHER TGP FIELD EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT MLV #67 TO INSTALL A MANUAL PRESSURE GAUGE TO IDENTIFY ANY PRESSURE ISSUES ON THE PIPELINE AS WELL.  THESE RESPONSE TIMES WERE MUCH LONGER THAN NORMAL DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER AND VERY ICY ROAD CONDITIONS.  AT 19:20-HOUR, FIELD PERSONAL CONFIRMED LINE 100-1 WAS LOSING PRESSURE AND PROCEEDED TO CLOSE BOTH MLV'S.  AT 21:40 TGP REPORTED TO THE EMA THAT THE PRESSURE BETWEEN MLV #68 AND #67 WAS ZERO (0) PSIG.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE EMA OPENED JACK THOMPSON ROAD, AND THE EVACUATED RESIDENTS RETURNED HOME.  TGP STARTED THE REMEDIATION PROCESS FOR LINE 100-1 BY REPLACING THE SEGMENT CONTAINING THE LEAK.  ON MARCH 1, 2021, THE REMOVED PIPE SPECIMEN CONTAINING THE LEAK BEGAN TRANSPORTATION BY TRUCK FROM THE HOLLY SPRINGS AREA TO BLADE ENERGY PARTNERS IN HOUSTON TX FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS.  IN ADDITION, THE VALVE SECTION OF LINE 100-1 RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 16:28-HOUR ON THE SAME DAY.  THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED AND THE LABORATORY REPORT WAS LAST ISSUED ON JUNE 30, 2021.  THE ANALYSIS RESULTED IN FINDING A LARGE THROUGH-WALL CRACK WITH A MAXIMUM CRACK OPENING OF 0.27 INCH AS FOUND ALONG THE CREST OF THE SECOND WRINKLE FROM THE UPSTREAM.  THE LENGTH OF THE CRACK IS 4.1 FEET.  THE FRACTURE SURFACE APPEARS TO BE CRYSTALLINE TYPE AND SHINY, WITH NUMEROUS FRESH RUST SPOTS.  CHEVRON MARKS ARE OBSERVED WITH THEIR APEXES TOWARDS THE 1.5-FOOT LONG ORIGIN OF THE CRACKING. THE FAILURE APPEARS TO BE BRITTLE, LITTLE PLASTIC DEFORMATION WAS OBSERVED NEAR THE FRACTURE SURFACE.  CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SAMPLE INDICATES THE MATERIAL COMPLIES WITH API REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1940'S.  TENSILE TESTS SHOWS THE SAMPLE CONFORMS TO SMYS FOR X45 STEEL.   ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS AND HARDNESS MEASUREMENTS FOUND DIFFERENCES, WHICH MAY BE CONTRIBUTED TO RE-HEATING THE PIPE BODY IN THE FIELD FOR THE BENDING DURING INSTALLATION.  IT IS NOTED THE TEMPERATURE DROP DURING THE POLAR VORTEX IN THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 14, 2021, COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE IN THE WRINKLE BEND AS WELL AS HARD SPOTS FROM RE-HEATING OF THE STEEL, WHICH INCREASED BRITTLENESS.  CLEAVAGE CRACKING OCCURRED WHEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PIPE DROPPED NEAR OR BELOW FREEZING TEMPERATURE AND PROPAGATED RAPIDLY THROUGH THE WALL IN BRITTLE MANNER."

AT THE TIME OF EVENT, THE TGP OPERATOR, WORKING FROM COMPRESSOR STATION 313, RECOGNIZED A FLOW CHANGE AND INITIATED INVESTIGATION. SIMULTANEOUSLY, A NATIONAL FUEL GAS (NFG) OPERATOR, WORKING IN THE AREA OF THE LITTLE ACRE FACILITY, HEARD THE RELEASE AND CONTACTED THE ON-DUTY TGP OPERATOR AT 13:21 EST.  THE TGP OPERATOR NOTIFIED OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR AND ON-CALL OPERATIONS SPECIALIST AT 13:25 EST.  AFTER CONFIRMING ASSET OWNERSHIP, PERFORMING SAFE APPROACH PROTOCOLS, AND CONFIRMING PRESSURE WAS BELOW ESTABLISHED MAOP, THE TGP OPERATIONS SPECIALIST ISOLATED RELIEF VALVE AT APPROXIMATELY 13:51 EST.  LINE PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF EVENT WAS 1161 PSIG AND SET PRESSURE OF RELIEF VALVE WAS 1250 PSIG.     AT 17:20 EST, AN INTERNAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE (ERL) CALL COMMENCED AND DURING THAT CALL, TGP PERSONNEL ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD DETERMINED THE RELEASE VOLUME EXCEEDED 3,000 MSCF.  AT 17:34 EST, TGP NOTIFIED THE NRC (REPORT NO. 1298603) OF THE EVENT AND ESTIMATED THE TOTAL GAS LOSS AT GREATER THAN 3,000 MSCF.  THE TOTAL UN-INTENTIONAL GAS LOSS WAS LATER DETERMINED TO BE 28,216 MSCF AND REPORTED TO THE NRC (REPORT NO. 1298717) AS A 48-HR UPDATE.    IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE RELIEF VALVE MALFUNCTION INCLUDED ICE BUILD-UP WITHIN THE POWER GAS TUBING LINE RUNNING FROM THE BODY OF THE RELIEF VALVE TO PILOT CONTROL.  THE POWER GAS TUBING LINE BROKE OFF WHERE THE TUBING THREADS INTO THE VALVE BODY DUE TO THE BUILD-UP OF ICE INSIDE THE TUBING AND RELIEF VALVE BODY.  FAILURE OF THE RELIEF VALVE PILOT CONTROL LINE, WHICH SUPPLIES PRESSURE TO THE TOP OF THE VALVE, KEEPING IT IN THE CLOSED POSITION, ULTIMATELY REMOVED PRESSURE FROM THE TOP OF THE RELIEF VALVE AND ALLOWED THE RELIEF VALVE SEAT TO LIFT, INITIATING THE RELEASE.    THE ICE FORMATION WITHIN THE POWER GAS TUBING AND RELIEF DEVICE RESULTED FROM EXCESS HYDRATE FORMATION DUE TO EXTREMELY COLD AMBIENT TEMPERATURES LEADING UP TO THE EVENT.

THE TEXGEN HANDLEY POWER PLANT IS SUPPLIED NATURAL GAS VIA PIPELINE FROM THE 9046 HANDLEY 12IN LATERAL AT THE HANDLEY 2100 YARD.     GAS CONTROL NOTIFIED OPERATIONS PERSONNEL THAT THE RELIEF VALVE ACTUATED AT APPROXIMATELY 06:45. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION AT 06:58, AND OPERATIONS MANAGER WAS NOTIFIED AT 07:03. DUE TO HAZARDOUS ROAD CONDITIONS RESPONSE TIME WAS GREATER THAN NORMAL. GAS CONTROL DID NOT CLOSE THE CONTROL VALVE AT THE SUPPLY POINT BECAUSE THE TEXGEN HANDLEY POWER PLANT COULD NOT BE OFFLINE DURING THE EXTREME WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS, AS IT WAS CRITICAL TO THE ELECTRIC GRID.     OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 09:00 AND THE MAINLINE BLOCK VALVE WAS CLOSED AT 09:16. ONCE THE PRESSURE WAS RELIEVED ENOUGH FOR THE RELIEF VALVE TO RE-SEAT, THEN THE MAINLINE BLOCK VALVE WAS RE-OPENED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE POWER PLANT. OPERATIONS BEGAN ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION AND DETERMINED THAT THE GAS SUPPLY LINE TUBING EXPERIENCED A FREEZE, THE FREEZE WAS IDENTIFIED, AND THE SUPPLY LINE WAS CLEARED. OPERATIONS REINSULATED THE GAS SUPPLY LINES. THE FLOW TO THE TEXGEN HANDLEY POWER PLANT AT THE HANDLEY 2100 YARD WAS NEVER FULLY INTERRUPTED.     DUE TO THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THE SUPPLY POINT TO THE TEXGEN HANDLEY POWER PLANT DURING THE EXTREMELY COLD WEATHER CONDITIONS, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL REMAINED ON SITE AT THE LOCATION TO MINIMIZE ANY DOWN TIME TO THE TEXGEN HANDLEY POWER PLANT. ENERGY TRANSFER'S PLAN TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE INCLUDES OVERHAULING THE REGULATOR AT THE HANDLEY 2100 YARD.  DUE TO THE AGE OF THE REGULATOR THE LEAD TIME FOR REPLACEMENT PARTS IS CURRENTLY 12 WEEKS.  REPLACEMENT OF THE PILOT AND HEATER FOR THE GAS SUPPLY LINE WAS COMPLETED MARCH 3, 2021."

FOLLOW UP (#1300352) ON MARCH 15TH.  IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT A POWER GAS SUPPLY VALVE, WHICH IS ALSO THE SUPPLY GAS FOR THE STATION ESD SYSTEM, WAS IN THE CLOSED POSITION.  THE CLOSED POWER GAS SUPPLY VALVE ISOLATED NOT ONLY THE ACTUATOR SUPPLY GAS TO THE STATION MAIN LINE SUCTION VALVE, BUT ALSO ISOLATED THE ESD PILOT SUPPLY GAS.  IT IS ASSUMED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL LEAK ON THE POWER SUPPLY/ESD SUPPLY GAS PIPING THAT CAUSED THE ESD PILOT PRESSURE TO FALL BELOW THE ESD PRESSURE SWITCH SETPOINT.  WHEN THE PRESSURE SETPOINT OPENS THE ELECTRIC SIDE OF THE ESD SYSTEM WILL TRIGGER AN ESD AND VENT THE REMAINING ESD PILOT PRESSURE CAUSING THE STATION ESD VALVES TO ACTUATE.    PRIOR TO THE ESD (3/10/2021), ANNUAL VALVE MAINTENANCE OCCURRED AT THE INACTIVE HINTON TURBINE COMPRESSOR STATION. ALL STATION VALVES WERE OPERATED AND LUBRICATED DURING MAINTENANCE THIS DAY, INCLUDING THE POWER GAS SUPPLY VALVE.  ON THIS DAY, THE TECHNICIAN STATED HE FOUND THE POWER GAS SUPPLY VALVE IN THE CLOSED POSITION. ALTHOUGH IT WAS CLOSED, THE TECHNICIAN PERFORMED THE REQUIRED MAINTENANCE AND LEFT THE VALVE IN A CLOSED POSITION. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED WHEN THE VALVE WAS INADVERTENTLY CLOSED.

UPON RECEIPT OF THE ALARM, GAS CONTROL DISPATCHED A TECHNICIAN TO THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE. AFTER ARRIVING ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 12:55AM THE TECHNICIAN FOUND VALVE 542AS-2R, AN EMERGENCY VALVE WHICH IS USED TO ISOLATE THE STATION IN THE EVENT OF THE ESD, OPEN AND THE VALVE SELECTOR IN THE MANUAL POSITION. AFTER CHANGING THE VALVE SELECTOR TO THE AUTOMATIC POSITION THE VALVE CLOSED AT 1:05AM, ENDING THE GAS RELEASE. INITIAL GAS RELEASE ESTIMATES PUT THE RELEASE BELOW THE 3,000 MCF THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING. LATER THAT MORNING AT 9:40AM TGP HAD CONFIRMED DISCOVERY OF THE INCIDENT WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE INITIAL GAS RELEASE CALCULATIONS WERE INCORRECT AND THE GAS LOSS WOULD EXCEED THE REPORTABLE THRESHOLD.     TGP BEGAN TESTING THE ESD SYSTEM AT STATION 542 ON OCTOBER 26, 2020. DURING THIS TEST, TGP SWITCHED THE VALVE 542AS-2R SELECTOR INTO THE MANUAL POSITION AND INSTALLED PLUGS WITHOUT WEEP HOLES INTO THE ESD SYSTEM. TGP STATION 542 HAS A PRESSURE TO ACTIVATE ESD SYSTEM. THE PLUGS WITH WEEP HOLES DO NOT ALLOW A SMALL VALVE LEAK ON THE ESD SYSTEM TO PRESSURIZE THE ESD SYSTEM AND TRIGGER AN ESD. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE ESD TEST, TGP DID NOT REINSTALL THE PLUGS WITH WEEP HOLES INTO THE SYSTEM. THE ESD SYSTEM WAS ACTIVATED AS A RESULT OF THE SYSTEM SLOWLY BECOMING PRESSURIZED DUE TO NOT REINSTALLING THE PLUGS WITH WEEP HOLES INTO THE ESD SYSTEM AFTER COMPLETION OF THE ESD TEST. BECAUSE THE VALVE 542AS-2R SELECTOR WAS IN THE MANUAL POSITION, THE VALVE DID NOT CLOSE WHEN THE ESD SYSTEM WAS ACTIVATED. RESULTANTLY, AFTER THE ESD, GAS CONTINUED TO VENT UNTIL THE VALVE 542AS-2R SELECTOR WAS PLACED INTO THE AUTOMATIC POSITION.     TGP HAS REVOKED THE OPERATOR QUALIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH ESD TESTING FOR THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE OCTOBER 2020 ESD TEST. TGP WILL INSTALL SIGNAGE TO REMIND EMPLOYEES TO LEAVE THE ESD REMOTE VALVE SELECTORS IN THE AUTOMATIC POSITION. TGP WILL REVISE ITS STATION 542 ESD TESTING PROCEDURES TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS FOR LEAVING THE WEEP-HOLE PLUGS IN THE ESD SYSTEM DURING THE TEST AND LEAVING ESD VALVE SELECTORS IN THE CORRECT POSITION UPON COMPLETION OF THE TEST.     IN PART E 1.A, THE ESTIMATED GAS FLOW IN PIPE SEGMENT AT THE POINT AND TIME OF THE INCIDENT (MSCF/D) IS 1,322,000 MSCF/D."

NRC WAS NOTIFIED LESS THAN ONE HOUR LATER. THE LOCATION OF THE BUBBLES WAS MAPPED AND CONFIRMED TO BE WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO MGS A PIPELINE. PRODUCTION ON THE PLATFORM WAS SHUT-IN AND PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED TO LIMIT THE LEAK TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WHILE MAINTAINING POSITIVE PRESSURE INSIDE THE PIPELINE. LOCAL DIVE RESOURCES WERE CONTACTED AND CONTRACTED TO BEGIN GATHERING AND PLANNING FOR PIPELINE REPAIRS.    ON APRIL 2, 2021 THE PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS LOWERED TO 64 PSIG.  ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO MAINTAIN ELECTRICAL GENERATION AND HEAT UTILIZING DIESEL GENERATORS.  SUBSEA SONAR RESOURCES WERE ENGAGED AND BEGAN PREPARING FOR A MULTI-BEAM SONAR SURVEY OF THE AREA TO VERIFY THE LEAK AND DETERMINE THE LEAK LOCATION. MONITORING OF ICE FLOWS AND WEATHER CONDITIONS BEGAN FOR THE AREA, SO THE SUBSEA RESOURCES COULD BE SAFELY MOBILIZED.    ON APRIL 3, 2021 OPERATIONS SHUT IN MGS A GAS PIPELINE.

THE DAMAGED PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS REMOVED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND PIPELINE ENDS STABILIZED.    ON AUGUST 27, 2021 ADV INTEGRITY ISSUED A ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS TO HILCORP AS FOLLOWS:    1. THE SUBJECT FAILURE OCCURRED DUE TO A TIME-DEPENDENT CRACKING MECHANISM, LIKELY FATIGUE, WHICH WAS LIKELY EXACERBATED BY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. THE FEATURES IDENTIFIED WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL PIPELINE STRESS CORROSION CRACKING.  2. THE LOCAL STRESS STATE CONTRIBUTED TO THE OBSERVED THROUGH-WALL CRACK. THIS LOCAL STRESS STATE INCLUDED: (1) THE HIGH TENSILE LOAD RESULTING FROM THE PIPE'S CONTOUR ACROSS THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING, (2) THE PRESENCE OF THE PLIDCO CLAMP IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE FAILURE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE RIGIDITY OF THE PIPELINE, AND (3) THE REDUCED WALL THICKNESS AS A RESULT OF EXTERNAL CORROSION AND ABRASION.  3. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PIPE AND GIRTH WELD WERE CONSISTENT WITH API 5L, GRADE B MATERIAL.    SUBPART K SELECTION DESCRIPTIONS:    - PREVIOUS MECHANICAL DAMAGE NOT RELATED TO EXCAVATION: THE PREVIOUS OWNER INSTALLED A PLIDCO PIPE CLAMP IN 2014 JUST UPSTREAM OF THE FAILURE LOCATION. IMPROPER SUPPORT OF THE PIPELINE DURING AND AFTER LIFTING COULD ALSO IMPART RESULTING STRESS AT AND NEARBY THE PLIDCO.    - EXTERNAL CORROSION, GALVANIC: REDUCED WALL THICKNESS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION AND ABRASION WHERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF THE LEAK.    - INSTALLATION RELATED: INCREASED TENSILE LOAD RESULTING FROM THE PIPE'S CONTOUR ACROSS THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING, AND THE INCREASED RIGIDITY FROM THE NEAR BY PLIDCO CLAMP INCREASING THE STRESS CONCENTRATION FACTOR IN THAT LOCATION.    THIS PIPELINE WILL NOT BE BROUGHT BACK INTO SERVICE AS HILCORP HAS DECIDED TO PURSUE THE ABANDONMENT OF THIS LINE.    NOTE: THE ORIGINAL REPORT SUBMITTED ON 4/29/21 ERRONEOUSLY REPORTED 1,052 MCF UNINTENTIONAL AND 1,567 MCF INTENTIONAL RELEASE VOLUMES DUE TO CONFUSION OVER THE DEFINITION OF THESE TWO METRICS.  2,619 MCF OF GAS WAS UNINTENTIONALLY RELEASED FROM THE TIME THE LEAK BEGAN UNTIL THE SHUT-IN PIPELINE PRESSURE EQUALIZED WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE INLET. CONTROLLED AND INTENTIONAL DISPLACEMENT OF GAS USING NITROGEN WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE LEAK. MULTI-BEAM SONAR FIRST CONFIRMED THE LOCATION.

THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE ESD WAS IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF TUBING WHICH DISENGAGED FROM ITS TERMINATION POINT. THE TUBING WAS UNDER PIPELINE PRESSURE AT THE TIME AND RESULTED IN A DROP IN SUPPLY POWER GAS PRESSURE WHICH TRIGGERED THE ESD. THE RELEASE WAS DUE TO A SINGLE STATION ESD VALVE MOVING OUT OF SEQUENCE WITH THE OTHER FOUR (4) ESD SYSTEM VALVES. THE OUT OF SEQUENCE ESD VALVE WAS INADVERTENTLY LEFT CONNECTED TO THE PREVIOUS POWER GAS SYSTEM, WHICH ALLOWED IT TO MOVE WHILE THE OTHER ESD VALVES DID NOT.  THE REMAINING FOUR (4) ESD VALVES THAT DID NOT MOVE WERE CORRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE NEW POWER GAS SYSTEM INSTALLED IN 2020. THE NEW ESD SYSTEM HAS BEEN TESTED TWICE SINCE INSTALLATION, AND THE ISSUE WAS NOT MADE EVIDENT IN THE TESTS.  CORRECTIVE ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN, AND THE SYSTEM WILL BE RETESTED BEFORE BEING PUT BACK INTO SERVICE.  VERIFICATION OF TUBING CONNECTIONS AND POWER GAS SYSTEM WILL BE CONDUCTED BEFORE RETURNING TO SERVICE AS WELL.      DUE TO THE INCORRECT POWER GAS SUPPLY, THE ESD BLOW OFF VALVE FAILED TO THE OPEN POSITION WHILE THE MAINLINE TAP VALVES REMAINED IN THE OPEN POSITION. AS A RESULT, THE STATION WAS NOT ISOLATED FROM THE MAINLINE WHICH RESULTED IN THE STATION BLOWDOWN VENTING GAS FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 MINUTES. MNE'S FIELD PERSONNEL SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED THE MAINLINE TAP VALVES AFTER RECOGNIZING THAT THE MAINLINE TAP VALVES REMAINED IN THE OPEN POSITION.

AFTER INSTALLING A REDUCING ASSEMBLY THAT ALLOWS A TOOL TO BE LOWERED IN THE CASING PROVIDED BY THE CONTRACTOR, BOTH PARTIES PROCEEDED TO TEST THE COMPLETED ASSEMBLY. THE WELLHEAD MASTER VALVE WAS PARTIALLY OPENED TO EQUALIZE PRESSURE. THE CONTRACTOR NOTED THAT THE MASTER VALVE WAS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE AS EXPECTED DUE TO RELATIVELY HIGH-PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL ACROSS THE VALVE. THEY REPORTED THE PRESSURE WAS 1,140 PSIG AT 0900 HOURS. NO GAS COULD BE HEARD FLOWING THROUGH THE VALVE, BUT THE SUBCONTRACTOR INDICATED THERE WAS A SLIGHT LEAK BUBBLING BETWEEN THE COMPANION FLANGE AND THE REDUCING FITTING, THEREFORE, BOTH THE CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR CLOSED THE MASTER VALVE AND THEN OPERATED A BLEED-OFF VALVE, RELEASING THE PRESSURE BUILDUP.    THE LEAK WAS REMEDIATED BY TIGHTENING THE REDUCING FITTING WITH A PIPE WRENCH BY APPROXIMATELY A HALF-TURN ON THE FITTING. WITH THE LEAK REMEDIATED, THE MASTER VALVE WAS SLOWLY OPENED AGAIN WITH DIFFICULTY. IT TYPICALLY TAKES 2-4 TURNS OF THE VALVE TO ACHIEVE FULL-OPEN STATUS, AFTER APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 TO 2 TURNS OF THE MASTER VALVE, THE ASSEMBLY FAILED. THE SIX PERSONNEL ON-SITE VACATED THE WORK AREA, THREE OF WHICH RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION DUE TO FACIAL ABRASIONS AND POTENTIAL HEARING LOSS.    ONCE THE AREA WAS SECURED AND NORTHERN NATURAL GAS EVALUATED THE SCENARIO, A WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR WAS TO MOBILIZE TO REMEDIATE THE VENTING GAS. THE WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR ARRIVED ON-SITE AT AND CONFERRED WITH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AT 2345 HOURS, AND DUE TO LACK OF DAYLIGHT AND PRESENCE OF NEARBY EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES, IT WAS DECIDED TO RE-EVALUATE THE NEXT MORNING. AROUND 0700 ON JULY 16, 2021, THE WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR DELAYED THE RESPONSE EFFORT DUE TO POOR LIGHTING AND LIMITED VISIBILITY CAUSED BY EARLY MORNING FOG. ONCE THE FOG LIFTED, THE WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR ASSESSED THE SITE AND CLOSED THE MASTER VALVE AT 1001 HOURS ON JULY 16, 2021. IT WAS NOTED BY THE WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR THAT THE MASTER VALVE HAD A SLIGHT LEAK AND WAS REMEDIATED BY INSTALLING A SECOND MASTER VALVE ABOVE THE ORIGINAL CONTAINING THE LEAK FULLY AT 1125 HOURS.    THE PRELIMINARY EVALUATION DETERMINED THE THREADED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COMPANION FLANGE AND REDUCING FITTING DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT THREAD ENGAGEMENT. THE INADEQUATE CONNECTION COULD NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT HYDRAULIC STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND THE PRESSURE NOR THE MECHANICAL STRENGTH TO RESIST THE BENDING MOMENT IMPARTED BY THE SUSPENDED WIRELINE ASSEMBLY.    PRELIMINARY LAB ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BETWEEN AUGUST 30, 2021 ' SEPTEMBER 1, 2021 FOUND THE COMPANION FLANGE, SWAGE PIN, WAS UNDERSIZE BY 0.0325 INCHES AND THE REDUCING FITTING WAS OVER SIZED BY 0.0305 INCHES. THE THREADS ON THE COMPANION FLANGE WERE ALSO SHORT LENGTH 2-INCHES INSTEAD OF THE FULL LENGTH OF 4-INCHES, WHICH LIMITED THE NUMBER OF THREADS AVAILABLE FOR FULL ENGAGEMENT ACROSS 4-INCHES. THIS LACK OF AVAILABLE ENGAGEMENT AND COMPONENTS OUTSIDE ACCEPTABLE TOLERANCE, PREVENTED THE ASSEMBLY FROM PROPERLY HOLDING TOGETHER UNDER THE DESIGNED PRESSURE."

THEY WENT TO INVESTIGATE THE NOISE AND SAW THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING ENGULFED IN FIRE. THEY REACTED AND FOLLOWED THEIR EMERGENCY SHUT DOWN PROCEDURE. THE PROCEDURE INCLUDED HITTING THE EMERGENCY STOP BUTTON FOR THE COMPRESSOR, CLOSING VALVES, AND MAKING NOTIFICATIONS. AT NO TIME DID THE TECHS DETECT THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS EITHER VISUALLY NOR DID THEY SMELL ODORANT INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS. MEMBERS OF THE RESPONDING FIRE DEPARTMENTS DID NOT DETECT THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS EITHER VISUALLY WHILE FIGHTING THE FIRE NOR DID ANYONE SMELL ODORANT INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS. THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED ON SITE UNTIL ABOUT 2100HRS. TWO FIRE CHIEFS AND A DISTRICT FIRE CHIEF STATED THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT POINT OF ORIGINATION OF THE FIRE, INITIAL FUEL SOURCE OF THE FIRE, OR THE POINT OF IGNITION. THEY RELEASED THE SCENE BACK TO ON SITE COMPANY PERSONNEL BEFORE DEPARTING. THE STORAGE FIELD TECHS CONDUCTED CHECKS OF JOINTS IN AND AROUND THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE HEAT OF THE FIRE WITH COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR INSTRUMENTS. GAS WAS NOT DETECTED. CONTACT WAS MADE WITH A THIRD-PARTY FIRE INVESTIGATOR. THE INVESTIGATOR REVIEWED THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING IN PERSON THE MORNING AFTER THE FIRE. THE FIRE INVESTIGATOR WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT POINT OF ORIGINATION OF THE FIRE, INITIAL FUEL SOURCE OF THE FIRE, OR THE POINT OF IGNITION. THE LOSS IS ESTIMATED TO BE A TOTAL LOSS OF THE BUILDING AND POSSIBLY THE TWO COMPRESSORS IN THE BUILDING.   NOTE: THE BUILDING IS INTACT. IT IS A STEEL FRAMED BUILDING WITH A SHEET METAL SKIN. THERE IS NO DEBRIS FIELD. WHILE DOORS (THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE OPEN) AND WINDOWS WERE DAMAGED, THEY WERE DAMAGED BY THE FIRE ' AS AN EXAMPLE, METAL DOORS SHOWED SIGNS OF WARPING FROM BEING SUPERHEATED AS OPPOSED TO BULGING FROM AN OVERPRESSURE EVENT. GLASS FROM LIGHTS IN DOORS AND WINDOWS WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE WINDOW NOT MORE THAN TWO FEET FROM THE BASE OF THE WALL, AGAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF FIRE DAMAGE, NOT OVER PRESSURIZATION. THE COMPRESSORS ARE SKID MOUNTED AND DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE MOVED OR SHIFTED POSITION. THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A SHEEN OF OIL ANYWHERE IN THE BUILDING THAT ANYONE NOTED. THE PAINT ON THE COMPRESSOR THAT WAS RUNNING AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE SHOWS SIGNS OF HEAT DAMAGE BUT OTHERWISE NO SCORCHING INDICATING IT WAS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF FUEL OR IGNITION. WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE HOTTEST SPOT OF THE FIRE IS IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE BUILDING ON THE DISCHARGE SIDE OF THE RUNNING COMPRESSOR. IT IS CLOSER TO THE RADIATOR THAN THE COMPRESSOR. ALL WIRING TO THE VARIOUS SENSORS ON THE COMPRESSORS APPEARS TO BE DAMAGED/MELTED AS THE RESULT OF THE FIRE. AT THIS POINT, IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE IF THE COMPRESSORS AND BUILDING ARE A TOTAL LOSS. THEY WILL HAVE TO BE ASSESSED BY ENGINEERS TO DETERMINE WHAT EXACTLY CAN BE SALVAGED. AT THE TIME THE STORAGE FIELD AND COMPRESSORS WERE PLACED INTO SERVICE (1954), AN ESD WAS NOT REQUIRED BY CODE. PLANS TO INSTALL AN ESD SYSTEM HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THE STATE REGULATORY AGENCY EARLIER IN 2021 AND HAD ADVANCED TO THE COMPLETED ENGINEERING PHASE AND WERE WAITING FOR APPROVAL AND AUTHORIZATION. GAS CONTROL AND THE STORAGE FIELD TECHS CAN OPERATE VALVES TO BYPASS THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING TO FEED EITHER THE STORAGE FIELD OR THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. THESE COMPRESSOR/STORAGE FIELD FACILITIES ARE NOT THE SOLE SOURCE OF GAS TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IT AUGMENTED."

THE FAILURE RESULTED IN AN EXPLOSION, FIRE, AND EJECTION OF A 46-FOOT SECTION OF THE PIPELINE. A HOME NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF E RANDOLPH ROAD AND N VAIL ROAD WAS DESTROYED BY THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE, RESULTING IN TWO FATALITIES AND ONE INJURY.  SHORTLY AFTER THE RUPTURE, THE KINDER MORGAN'S COLORADO SPRINGS CONTROL CENTER OBSERVED A PRESSURE DECREASE THROUGH ITS SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM AND CONTACTED FIELD PERSONNEL TO ISOLATE THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SEGMENT. ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE CONTROL CENTER RECEIVED A REPORT OF THE FIRE FROM A NEARBY POWER PLANT. ISOLATION OF THE AFFECTED SEGMENT REQUIRED CLOSING TWO MANUALLY OPERATED VALVES, ONE UPSTREAM AND ONE DOWNSTREAM OF THE RUPTURE. KINDER MORGAN FIELD PERSONNEL MANUALLY ISOLATED THE NEAREST DOWNSTREAM VALVE ABOUT 1 HOUR AFTER THE RUPTURE BUT HAD DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE NEAREST UPSTREAM VALVE. THE NEAREST UPSTREAM WAS ISOLATED ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS AFTER THE RUPTURE, AND THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED AT 8:08 A.M.""    THE NTSB IS CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT.      THE RECORDED PRESSURE NEAREST THE INCIDENT SITE WAS 830 PSIG. EPNG CALCULATED THE PRESSURE AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF THE INCIDENT TO BE 863 PSIG.

CALL CENTER OF A GAS ODOR INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING LOCATED AT 733 PARK AVE.  THE GAS ODOR HAD BEEN REPORTED TO THE CALL CENTER BY AN OCCUPANT OF THE SAME BUILDING.  THE AREA IS SUPPLIED BY A 6-INCH LOW-PRESSURE CAST IRON GAS MAIN (INSTALLED IN 1897) AND A 30-INCH STEEL GAS TRANSMISSION MAIN (INSTALLED IN 1959), AS WELL AS UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC FACILITIES.  CON EDISON GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) RESPONDED TO THE LOCATION, INVESTIGATED, AND REPORTED A TYPE 1 GAS LEAK, WITH A NATURAL GAS READING OF 0.4% DETECTED IN THE GAS POINT-OF-ENTRY (POE) AT 733 PARK AVENUE.  ADDITIONALLY, GDS DETECTED NATURAL GAS READINGS OF 15% IN TWO NEARBY ELECTRIC SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES (SSS'S) MANHOLE #M41786 AND SERVICE BOX #12935; THE COVERS OF THOSE TWO SSS'S WERE REMOVE BY GDS FOR VENTING.  THE GERC THEN INITIATED A CODE MURRE, NOTIFIED THE FDNY, AND DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL CON EDISON GDS SUPERVISION TO THE LOCATION.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, GDS DETECTED NATURAL GAS READINGS OF 0.3% IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF TWO BUILDING BASEMENTS AT 106 & 110 E. 71ST STREET.  GDS SEALED THE ELECTRIC POE'S TO THOSE BUILDINGS AND VENTED THE READINGS IN THE TWO BASEMENTS TO 0% WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE FDNY.  GDS REPORTED THAT ALL OTHER BUILDINGS AND ADJACENT SSS'S WERE CLEAR OF GAS READINGS, AND THAT ELECTRIC MH #M41786 AND SB #12935 HAD BEEN VENTED TO 0%.  CON EDISON EMERGENCY GAS CONSTRUCTION PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION TO PINPOINT THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.     ON 11/7/21 AT 00:50, EMERGENCY GAS CONSTRUCTION REPORTED FINDING A POTENTIAL LEAK ON THE 30-INCH TRANSMISSION MAIN AFTER DETECTING NATURAL GAS READINGS OF ~100% IN THE VICINITY OF THE MAIN.  ALL ADJACENT SSS'S, BUILDINGS, AND PROTECTION TEST POINTS WERE CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE CLEAR OF GAS READINGS.  THE TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS OPERATING AT ~300 PSIG.  NO OUTAGES OR NEGATIVE GAS SYSTEM IMPACT WERE REPORTED.  GAS TRANSMISSION ENGINEERING AND GAS CONTROL WERE NOTIFIED OF THE POTENTIAL TRANSMISSION MAIN LEAK.  CONTINGENCY CASE 6-C WAS ESTABLISHED AND PUT INTO EFFECT, AND GAS OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE ASSIGNED TO STAFF MULTIPLE MAIN VALVES AS PART OF THE CONTINGENCY.  GAS OPERATIONS CREWS REMAINED ON LOCATION AND MONITORED THE CONDITION THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.      ON 11/7/21 AT 13:49, TWO TRANSMISSION MAIN VALVES WERE CLOSED TO ISOLATE A SEGMENT OF THE 30-INCH TRANSMISSION MAIN DUE TO THE LEAK CONDITION, WHICH APPEARED TO PROGRESSIVELY WORSEN.  THE ISOLATION OF THE TRANSMISSION MAIN INTERRUPTED SERVICE TO FIFTEEN (15) GAS SERVICES AND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO (932) CUSTOMERS.  CON EDISON GAS CONTROL ISSUED A LIMIT WORK ORDER AND A CONDITION YELLOW SYSTEM STATUS.  CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES BEGAN AND THE COATING ON THE TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS SAFELY REMOVED.  ONCE FULLY EXPOSED, A LEAK WAS FOUND ON THE TRANSMISSION MAIN AT THE 1 O'CLOCK POSITION.  A NITROGEN BARRIER WAS INSTALLED, AND A HIGH HAT (A PERMANENT STEEL CAP) WAS WELDED OVER THE LEAK THAT WAS FOUND ON THE BODY OF THE TRANSMISSION MAIN.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS CONDUCTED, AND THE TEST PASSED.  TRANSMISSION PRESSURE WAS REINTRODUCED TO THE MAIN UP TO FULL OPERATING PRESSURE (327 PSIG) AT 50 PSIG INCREMENTS WITH LEAK SURVEYS CONDUCTED OVER THE AFFECTED AREA AT EVERY INCREMENTAL PRESSURE INCREASE, WITHOUT ANY FURTHER LEAKS DETECTED.  THE REPAIR PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, AND SERVICE WAS SAFELY RESTORED ON 11/9/21 AT 18:09.  THE SUSPECTED CAUSE OF THE NATURAL GAS LEAK WAS A HIGH-PRESSURE STEAM LEAK THAT WAS BLOWING DIRECTLY ON THE GAS TRANSMISSION MAIN.  THERE WERE NO REPORTED INJURIES OR EVACUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.  NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO PSC, DEP AND PHMSA."

HOWEVER, DURING THE COURSE OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE, AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM CST, ATMOS ENERGY DETERMINED THERE MAY BE SUFFICIENT DAMAGE TO ATMOS ENERGY'S PROPERTY TO EXCEED THE COST THRESHOLD ESTABLISHED IN 49 CFR 191.3.  THEREFORE, ATMOS ENERGY REPORTED THE EVENT TO NRC AT 10:07 AM CST.    ATMOS ENERGY DOES NOT HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATUS OF THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE AND WHETHER THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT.
